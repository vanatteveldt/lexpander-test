200411,61,61320,2,NA,NA,"As we come together to declare our vision as Democrats, we are mindful that the challenges of our times are new and profound."
200411,61,61320,3,NA,NA,"This November, the choice we face as Americans may have more impact on our people and our place in the world than any in our lifetimes."
200411,61,61320,4,NA,NA,"We approach this task with a seriousness that matches the challenges before us, but also with a profound optimism about our future - an optimism that springs from our great faith in America, and our great pride in what it means to be Americans."
200411,61,61320,5,NA,NA,We know the stakes are immeasurably high.
200411,61,61320,6,NA,NA,"For the first time in generations, we have been attacked on our own shores."
200411,61,61320,7,NA,NA,"Our brave men and women in uniform are still in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war against terror."
200411,61,61320,8,NA,NA,"Our alliances are frayed, our credibility in doubt."
200411,61,61320,9,NA,NA,Our great middle class is hard-pressed.
200411,61,61320,10,NA,NA,"Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, and millions more are struggling under the mounting burden of life's everyday costs."
200411,61,61320,11,NA,NA,"In Washington, the President and his allies stubbornly press on, without regard to the needs of our people or the challenges of our times."
200411,61,61320,12,NA,NA,It is time for a new direction.
200411,61,61320,13,NA,NA,"John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democratic Party bring a new vision for America - strong at home, respected abroad."
200411,61,61320,14,NA,NA,"An America that offers opportunity, rewards responsibility, and rejoices in diversity."
200411,61,61320,15,NA,NA,"We have a plan to build a strong, respected America: protecting our people, rebuilding our alliances, and leading the way to a more peaceful and prosperous world."

200411,61,61320,18,NA,NA,"And we will honor the values of a strong American community: widening the circle of equality, protecting the sanctity of freedom, and deepening our commitment to this country."
200411,61,61320,19,NA,NA,"In offering this vision, we affirm our faith in the greatness of America."
200411,61,61320,20,NA,NA,"We recommit to the ideal of a people united in helping one another, an ideal as old as the faiths we follow and as great as the country we love."
200411,61,61320,21,NA,NA,"To those who are threatened, we pledge protection; to those who are victims, we promise justice; to those who are hopeless, we offer hope."
200411,61,61320,22,NA,NA,"And to all Americans who seek a better future for themselves, for their loved ones, and for our country, we say: your cause is our own."
200411,61,61320,23,NA,NA,That is the America we believe in.
200411,61,61320,24,NA,NA,That is the America we are fighting for.
200411,61,61320,25,NA,NA,"That is the America we will build together - one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
200411,61,61320,27,NA,NA,"Alone among nations, America was born in pursuit of an idea - that a free people with diverse beliefs could govern themselves in peace."
200411,61,61320,28,NA,NA,"For more than a century, America has spared no effort to defend and promote that idea around the world."
200411,61,61320,29,NA,NA,"And over and over, that effort has been marked by the exercise of American leadership to forge powerful alliances based on mutual respect with longtime allies and reluctant friends; with nations already living in the light of democracy and with peoples struggling to join them."
200411,61,61320,30,NA,NA,"The might of our alliances, coupled with the strength of our democratic ideals, has been a driving force in the survival and success of freedom - in two World Wars, in the Korean War, in the Cold War, in the Gulf War and in Kosovo."
200411,61,61320,31,NA,NA,America led instead of going it alone.
200411,61,61320,32,NA,NA,"We extended a hand, not a fist."
200411,61,61320,33,NA,NA,We respected the world - and the world respected us.
200411,61,61320,34,NA,NA,"As Americans, we respect and honor our veterans."
200411,61,61320,35,NA,NA,We are indebted to all those courageous men and women who have answered our country's call to duty.
200411,61,61320,36,NA,NA,"Their service and sacrifice, their dedication and love of country advance our cause of freedom and uphold our finest traditions as a nation."
200411,61,61320,37,NA,NA,That is the America we believe in.
200411,61,61320,38,NA,NA,That is the America we are fighting for.
200411,61,61320,39,NA,NA,And that is the America we can be.
200411,61,61320,40,NA,NA,But the Bush Administration has walked away from more than a hundred years of American leadership in the world to embrace a new - and dangerously ineffective - disregard for the world.
200411,61,61320,41,NA,NA,They rush to force before exhausting diplomacy.
200411,61,61320,42,NA,NA,They bully rather than persuade.
200411,61,61320,43,NA,NA,They act alone when they could assemble a team.
200411,61,61320,44,NA,NA,They hope for the best when they should prepare for the worst.
200411,61,61320,45,NA,NA,"Time and again, this Administration confuses leadership with going it alone and engagement with compromise of principle."
200411,61,61320,46,NA,NA,They do not understand that real leadership means standing by your principles and rallying others to join you.
200411,61,61320,47,NA,NA,"John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democratic Party believe in a better, stronger America - an America that is respected, not just feared, and an America that listens and leads."
200411,61,61320,48,NA,NA,"Our vision has deep roots in our Declaration of Independence and Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Four Freedoms,"
200411,61,61320,49,NA,NA,"and in the tough-minded tradition of engagement and leadership-a tradition forged by Wilson and Roosevelt in two world wars, then championed by Truman and Kennedy during the Cold War."
200411,61,61320,50,NA,NA,"We believe in an America that people around the world admire, because they know we cherish not just our freedom, but theirs."
200411,61,61320,51,NA,NA,"Not just our democracy, but their hope for it."
200411,61,61320,52,NA,NA,"Not just our peace and security, but the world's."
200411,61,61320,53,NA,NA,"We believe in an America that cherishes freedom, safeguards our people, forges alliances, and commands respect."
200411,61,61320,54,NA,NA,That is the America we are going to build.
200411,61,61320,55,NA,NA,Our overriding goals are the same as ever: to protect our people and our way of life;
200411,61,61320,56,NA,NA,"and to help build a safer, more peaceful,"
200411,61,61320,57,NA,NA,"more prosperous,"
200411,61,61320,58,NA,NA,more democratic world.
200411,61,61320,59,NA,NA,"Today, we face three great challenges above all others - first, to win the global war against terror;"
200411,61,61320,60,NA,NA,"second, to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons;"
200411,61,61320,61,NA,NA,"and third, to promote democracy and freedom around the world, starting with a peaceful and stable Iraq."
200411,61,61320,62,NA,NA,"To meet these challenges, we need a new national security policy guided by four new imperatives:"
200411,61,61320,63,NA,NA,"First, America must launch and lead a new era of alliances for the post-September 11 world."
200411,61,61320,64,NA,NA,"Second, we must modernize the world's most powerful military to meet the new threats."
200411,61,61320,65,NA,NA,"Third, in addition to our military might, we must deploy all that is in America's arsenal -"
200411,61,61320,66,NA,NA,"our diplomacy,"
200411,61,61320,67,NA,NA,"our intelligence system,"
200411,61,61320,68,NA,NA,"our economic power,"
200411,61,61320,69,NA,NA,and the appeal of our values and ideas.
200411,61,61320,70,NA,NA,"Fourth and finally, to safeguard our freedom and ensure our nation's future, we must end our dependence on Mideast oil."
200411,61,61320,72,NA,NA,"Today, the Bush Administration is waging a war against a global terrorist movement committed to our destruction with insufficient understanding of our enemy or effort to address the underlying factors that can give rise to new recruits."
200411,61,61320,73,NA,NA,This war isn't just a manhunt.
200411,61,61320,74,NA,NA,"We cannot rest until Osama bin Laden is captured or killed, but that day will mark only a victory in the war on terror, not its end."
200411,61,61320,75,NA,NA,Terrorists like al Qaeda and its affiliates are unlike any adversary our nation has ever known.
200411,61,61320,76,NA,NA,"We face a global terrorist movement of many groups, funded from different sources with separate agendas, but all committed to assaulting the United States and free and open societies around the globe."
200411,61,61320,77,NA,NA,"Despite his tough talk, President Bush's actions against terrorism have fallen far short."
200411,61,61320,78,NA,NA,He still has no comprehensive strategy for victory.
200411,61,61320,79,NA,NA,"After allowing bin Laden to escape from our grasp at Tora Bora, he diverted crucial resources from the effort to destroy al Qaeda in Afghanistan."
200411,61,61320,80,NA,NA,His doctrine of unilateral preemption has driven away our allies and cost us the support of other nations.
200411,61,61320,81,NA,NA,"We must put in place a strategy to win - an approach that recognizes and addresses the many facets of this mortal challenge, from the terrorists themselves to the root causes that give rise to new recruits, and uses all the tools at our disposal."
200411,61,61320,82,NA,NA,"Agents of terrorism work in the shadows of more than 60 nations, on every continent."
200411,61,61320,83,NA,NA,"The only possible path to victory will be found in the company of others, not walking alone."
200411,61,61320,84,NA,NA,"With John Kerry as Commander-in-Chief, we will never wait for a green light from abroad when our safety is at stake,"
200411,61,61320,85,NA,NA,but we must enlist those whose support we need for ultimate victory.
200411,61,61320,86,NA,NA,Victory in the war on terror requires a combination of American determination and international cooperation on all fronts.
200411,61,61320,87,NA,NA,"It requires the ability and willingness to direct immediate, effective military action when the capture or destruction of terrorist groups and their leaders is possible;"
200411,61,61320,88,NA,NA,a massive improvement in intelligence gathering and analysis coupled with vigorous law enforcement;
200411,61,61320,89,NA,NA,a relentless effort to shut down the flow of terrorist funds;
200411,61,61320,90,NA,NA,a global effort to prevent failed or failing states that can become sanctuaries for terrorists;
200411,61,61320,91,NA,NA,a sustained effort to deny terrorists any more recruits by conducting effective public diplomacy;
200411,61,61320,92,NA,NA,"and a sustained political and economic effort to improve education,"
200411,61,61320,93,NA,NA,"work for peace,"
200411,61,61320,94,NA,NA,support democracy and extend hope.
200411,61,61320,96,NA,NA,We will train and equip the military to enhance its capabilities to seek out and destroy terrorists.
200411,61,61320,97,NA,NA,We will strengthen the capacity of intelligence and law enforcement around the world by forging stronger international coalitions to provide better information and communication.
200411,61,61320,98,NA,NA,We must also improve our intelligence here at home.
200411,61,61320,99,NA,NA,"From the failure to uncover the September 11th plot to the deeply misguided reports about Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction, we have experienced unprecedented intelligence failures in recent years."
200411,61,61320,100,NA,NA,We must do what President Bush has refused to do - reform our intelligence system by creating a true Director of National Intelligence with real control of intelligence personnel and budgets.
200411,61,61320,101,NA,NA,We must train more analysts in languages spoken by terrorists.
200411,61,61320,102,NA,NA,"And we must break down the old communications barriers between national intelligence and local law enforcement, taking care to fully preserve our liberties."
200411,61,61320,104,NA,NA,We will move decisively to cut off the flow of terrorist funds.
200411,61,61320,105,NA,NA,We will impose tough financial sanctions against nations or banks that engage in money laundering or fail to act against it.
200411,61,61320,106,NA,NA,We will strengthen our anti-money laundering laws to prevent terrorists from using hedge funds and unregulated institutions to finance terror.
200411,61,61320,107,NA,NA,"We will launch a ""name and shame"" campaign against those that are financing terror."
200411,61,61320,108,NA,NA,"If nations do not respond, they will be shut out of the U.S. financial system."
200411,61,61320,109,NA,NA,"And in the specific case of Saudi Arabia, we will put an end to the Bush Administration's kid-glove approach to the supply and laundering of terrorist money."
200411,61,61320,111,NA,NA,Nowhere is the need for collective endeavor greater than in Afghanistan.
200411,61,61320,112,NA,NA,The Bush Administration has badly mishandled the war's aftermath.
200411,61,61320,113,NA,NA,"Two years ago, President Bush promised a Marshall Plan to rebuild that country."
200411,61,61320,114,NA,NA,"Instead, he has all but turned away from Afghanistan, allowing it to become again a potential haven for terrorists."
200411,61,61320,115,NA,NA,We must expand NATO forces outside Kabul.
200411,61,61320,116,NA,NA,We must accelerate training for the Afghan army and police.
200411,61,61320,117,NA,NA,The program to disarm and reintegrate warlord militias into society must be expedited and expanded into a mainstream strategy.
200411,61,61320,118,NA,NA,We will attack the exploding opium trade ignored by the Bush Administration by doubling our counter-narcotics assistance to the Karzai Government and reinvigorating the regional drug control program.
200411,61,61320,119,NA,NA,"Beyond Afghanistan, terrorist attacks from Saudi Arabia and Indonesia to Kenya, Morocco, and Turkey point to a widening network of terrorists targeting this country and our friends."
200411,61,61320,120,NA,NA,Failed and failing states like Somalia or countries with large areas of limited government control like the Philippines and Indonesia need international help to close down terrorist havens.
200411,61,61320,122,NA,NA,At the core of this conflict is a fundamental struggle of ideas: democracy and tolerance against those who would use any means and attack any target to impose their narrow views.
200411,61,61320,123,NA,NA,The war on terror is not a clash of civilizations.
200411,61,61320,124,NA,NA,It is a clash of civilization against chaos.
200411,61,61320,125,NA,NA,America needs a major initiative in public diplomacy to support the many voices of freedom in the Arab and Muslim world.
200411,61,61320,126,NA,NA,"To improve education for the next generation of Islamic youth, we need a cooperative international effort to compete with radical Madrassas."
200411,61,61320,127,NA,NA,"And we must support human rights groups,"
200411,61,61320,128,NA,NA,"independent media,"
200411,61,61320,129,NA,NA,and labor unions dedicated to building a democratic culture from the grassroots up.
200411,61,61320,130,NA,NA,"Democracy will not blossom overnight, but America should speed its growth by sustaining the forces of democracy against repressive regimes and by rewarding governments that work toward this end."
200411,61,61320,132,NA,NA,There is no greater threat to American security than the possibility of terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction.
200411,61,61320,133,NA,NA,Preventing terrorists from gaining access to these weapons must be our number one security goal.
200411,61,61320,134,NA,NA,Containing this massive threat requires American leadership of the highest order -
200411,61,61320,135,NA,NA,"leadership that brings our allies, friends, and partners to greater collaboration and participation"
200411,61,61320,136,NA,NA,- and compels problem states to join and comply with international agreements and abandon their weapons programs.
200411,61,61320,137,NA,NA,"Unfortunately, this Administration's policies have moved America in the opposite direction."
200411,61,61320,138,NA,NA,They have weakened international agreements and efforts to enforce non-proliferation instead of strengthening them.
200411,61,61320,139,NA,NA,They have not done nearly enough to secure existing stockpiles and bomb-making materials.
200411,61,61320,140,NA,NA,They have failed to take effective steps to stop the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs.
200411,61,61320,141,NA,NA,We must change course now.
200411,61,61320,143,NA,NA,"First, the world should be on notice that we will take every possible measure to defend ourselves against the possibility of attack by unconventional arms."
200411,61,61320,144,NA,NA,"If such an attack appears imminent, we will do everything necessary to stop it."
200411,61,61320,145,NA,NA,"If such a strike does occur, we will respond with overwhelming and devastating force."
200411,61,61320,146,NA,NA,But we should never wait to act until we have no other choice but war.
200411,61,61320,147,NA,NA,We must build and lead an international consensus for early preventive action to lock up and secure existing weapons of mass destruction and the material to manufacture more.
200411,61,61320,149,NA,NA,The first step is to safeguard all bomb making material worldwide.
200411,61,61320,150,NA,NA,"We need to find it, catalog it, and lock it away."
200411,61,61320,151,NA,NA,Our approach should be simple: treat the nuclear materials that make bombs like they are bombs.
200411,61,61320,152,NA,NA,"More than a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia still has nearly 20,000 nuclear weapons and enough nuclear material to produce 50,000 more."
200411,61,61320,153,NA,NA,"For most of these weapons and materials, cooperative security upgrades have not been completed."
200411,61,61320,154,NA,NA,The world is relying on whatever measures Russia has taken on its own.
200411,61,61320,155,NA,NA,"At the current pace, it will take 13 years to secure potential bomb material in the former Soviet Union."
200411,61,61320,156,NA,NA,We cannot wait that long.
200411,61,61320,157,NA,NA,We will do it in four years.
200411,61,61320,159,NA,NA,We will lead an international coalition to put an end to the production of new materials - highly enriched uranium and plutonium - for use in nuclear weapons.
200411,61,61320,160,NA,NA,And we will reduce excess stocks of existing nuclear materials and weapons.
200411,61,61320,161,NA,NA,We will conduct a global cleanout initiative to remove stockpiles of vulnerable highly enriched uranium at research reactors and facilities in dozens of countries around the world within four years.
200411,61,61320,163,NA,NA,We must show determined leadership to end the nuclear weapons program in North Korea and prevent the development of nuclear weapons in places like Iran.
200411,61,61320,164,NA,NA,North Korea has sold ballistic missiles and technology in the past.
200411,61,61320,165,NA,NA,The North Koreans have made it clear to the world - and to the terrorists - that they are open for business and will sell to the highest bidder.
200411,61,61320,166,NA,NA,"But while this Administration has been fixated on Iraq, the nuclear dangers from North Korea have multiplied."
200411,61,61320,167,NA,NA,The North Koreans allegedly have made enough new fuel to make six to nine nuclear bombs.
200411,61,61320,168,NA,NA,"We should maintain the six-party talks, but we must also be prepared to talk directly with North Korea to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that addresses the full range of issues for ourselves and our allies."
200411,61,61320,169,NA,NA,But we should have no illusions about Kim Jong Il.
200411,61,61320,170,NA,NA,Any agreement must have rigorous verification and lead to complete and irreversible elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
200411,61,61320,171,NA,NA,"Even as we have scoured Iraq for signs of weapons of mass destruction, Iran has reportedly been working to develop them next door."
200411,61,61320,172,NA,NA,A nuclear-armed Iran is an unacceptable risk to us and our allies.
200411,61,61320,173,NA,NA,The same is true for other countries that may be seeking nuclear weapons.
200411,61,61320,174,NA,NA,This is why strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is so critical.
200411,61,61320,175,NA,NA,"We must close the loophole that lets countries develop nuclear weapons capabilities under the guise of a peaceful, civilian nuclear power program."
200411,61,61320,176,NA,NA,We also need to strengthen enforcement and verification and make rigorous inspection protocols mandatory.
200411,61,61320,177,NA,NA,"We must work with every country to tighten export controls,"
200411,61,61320,178,NA,NA,"stiffen penalties,"
200411,61,61320,179,NA,NA,and beef up law enforcement and intelligence sharing.
200411,61,61320,180,NA,NA,"That way we can make absolutely sure that a disaster like the AQ Khan black market network, which grew out of Pakistan's nuclear program, can never happen again."
200411,61,61320,181,NA,NA,We must also take steps to reduce tension between India and Pakistan and guard against the possibility of their nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.
200411,61,61320,183,NA,NA,"We know that promoting democracy,"
200411,61,61320,184,NA,NA,"human rights,"
200411,61,61320,185,NA,NA,and the rule of law is vital to our long-term security.
200411,61,61320,186,NA,NA,Americans will be safer in a world of democracies.
200411,61,61320,187,NA,NA,"We will work with people and nongovernmental organizations around the world struggling for freedom,"
200411,61,61320,188,NA,NA,even as we work with their governments to protect our security from weapons of terror.
200411,61,61320,189,NA,NA,We will restore America's credibility and commitment as a force for democracy
200411,61,61320,190,NA,NA,"and human rights, starting in Iraq."
200411,61,61320,191,NA,NA,"We believe that upholding international standards for the treatment of prisoners, wherever they may be held, advances America's national security, the security of our troops, and the values of our people."

200411,61,61320,195,NA,NA,while at the same time ensuring that our troops are protected.
200411,61,61320,197,NA,NA,"More than a year ago, President Bush stood on an aircraft carrier under a banner that proclaimed ""mission accomplished."
200411,61,61320,198,NA,NA,""" But today we know that the mission is not finished, hostilities have not ended, and our men and women in uniform fight almost alone with the target squarely on their backs."
200411,61,61320,199,NA,NA,"People of good will disagree about whether America should have gone to war in Iraq, but this much is clear: this Administration badly exaggerated its case, particularly with respect to weapons of mass destruction and the connection between Saddam's government and al Qaeda."
200411,61,61320,200,NA,NA,This Administration did not build a true international coalition.
200411,61,61320,201,NA,NA,This Administration disdained the United Nations weapons inspection process and rushed to war without exhausting diplomatic alternatives.
200411,61,61320,202,NA,NA,"Ignoring the advice of military leaders, this Administration did not send sufficient forces into Iraq to accomplish the mission."
200411,61,61320,203,NA,NA,And this Administration went into Iraq without a plan to win the peace.
200411,61,61320,204,NA,NA,Now this Administration has been forced to change course in order to correct this fundamental mistake.
200411,61,61320,205,NA,NA,They are now taking up the suggestions that many Democrats have been making for over a year.
200411,61,61320,206,NA,NA,"And they must - because having gone to war, we cannot afford to fail at peace."
200411,61,61320,207,NA,NA,We cannot allow a failed state in Iraq that inevitably would become a haven for terrorists and a destabilizing force in the Middle East.
200411,61,61320,208,NA,NA,"And we must secure more help from an international community that shares a huge stake in helping Iraq become a responsible member of that community, not a breeding ground for terror and intolerance."
200411,61,61320,209,NA,NA,"As a first step, we must create a stable and secure environment in Iraq."
200411,61,61320,210,NA,NA,"To do this right, we must truly internationalize both politically and militarily: we cannot depend on a US-only presence."
200411,61,61320,211,NA,NA,"Other nations have a vital interest in the outcome, and we must bring them in to commit troops and resources."
200411,61,61320,212,NA,NA,The Bush Administration has missed three great opportunities to do that.
200411,61,61320,213,NA,NA,"First, the President broke his promise to build a legitimate coalition in Iraq by exhausting diplomacy before resorting to the use of military force."
200411,61,61320,214,NA,NA,"Second, when the statue fell in Baghdad, Kofi Annan invited the United States to come to the table to discuss international support - but we rejected his offer."
200411,61,61320,215,NA,NA,"Third, when the President addressed the United Nations last fall, he once again refused to acknowledge the difficulties we faced in Iraq and failed to elicit support from other nations."
200411,61,61320,216,NA,NA,"The President has not given our troops the clarity of mission, the equipment or the international support they need and deserve."
200411,61,61320,217,NA,NA,We have a different approach based on a simple commitment: Troops come first.
200411,61,61320,218,NA,NA,Our helicopter pilots have flown battlefield missions without the best anti-missile systems.
200411,61,61320,219,NA,NA,"In a Democratic Administration, that will change."
200411,61,61320,220,NA,NA,"Too many of our nation's finest troops have died in attacks, because tens of thousands were deployed to Iraq without the best bulletproof vests, and there is a shortage of armored vehicles on the ground."
200411,61,61320,221,NA,NA,"In a Democratic Administration, that will change."
200411,61,61320,222,NA,NA,Thousands of National Guardsmen and reservists have been forced to leave their families and jobs for more than a year - with no end in sight - because this Administration ignored the pressing need for a true coalition.
200411,61,61320,223,NA,NA,"In a Democratic Administration, that will change."
200411,61,61320,224,NA,NA,"To succeed, America must do the hard work of engaging the world's major political powers in this mission."
200411,61,61320,225,NA,NA,"We must build a coalition of countries, including the other permanent members of the UN Security Council, to share the political, economic, and military responsibilities of Iraq with the United States."
200411,61,61320,226,NA,NA,"To win over allies, we must share responsibility with those nations that answer our call, and treat them with respect."
200411,61,61320,227,NA,NA,"We must lead, but we must listen."
200411,61,61320,228,NA,NA,The rewards of respect are enormous.
200411,61,61320,229,NA,NA,We must convince NATO to take on a more significant role and contribute additional military forces.
200411,61,61320,230,NA,NA,"As other countries, including Muslim majority countries, contribute troops, the United States will be able to reduce its military presence in Iraq, and we intend to do this when appropriate so that the military support needed by a sovereign Iraqi government will no longer be seen as the direct continuation of an American military presence."
200411,61,61320,231,NA,NA,"Second, we need to create an international High Commissioner to serve as the senior international representative working with the Iraqi government."
200411,61,61320,232,NA,NA,"This Commissioner should be backed by a newly broadened security coalition and charged with overseeing elections, assisting with drafting a constitution, and coordinating reconstruction."
200411,61,61320,233,NA,NA,"The Commissioner should be highly regarded by the international community, have the credibility to talk to all the Iraqi people, and work directly with Iraq's interim government, the new U.S. Ambassador, and the international community."
200411,61,61320,234,NA,NA,"At the same time, U.S. and international policies must take into consideration the best interests of the Iraqi people."
200411,61,61320,235,NA,NA,"The Iraqi people desperately need financial and technical assistance that is not swallowed up by bureaucracy and no-bid contracts, but instead goes directly into grassroots organizations."
200411,61,61320,236,NA,NA,"They need to see the tangible benefits of reconstruction: jobs, infrastructure, and services."
200411,61,61320,237,NA,NA,"They should also receive the full benefits of their own oil production as quickly as possible, so as to rebuild their country and help themselves as individuals,"
200411,61,61320,238,NA,NA,while also reducing the costs of security and reconstruction on the American taxpayer and the cost of gasoline to American consumers.
200411,61,61320,239,NA,NA,And they need to be able to communicate their concerns to international authorities without feeling they are being disrespected in their own country.
200411,61,61320,240,NA,NA,America also needs a massive training effort to build Iraqi security forces that can actually provide security for the Iraqi people.
200411,61,61320,241,NA,NA,It must be done in the field and on the job as well as in the classroom.
200411,61,61320,242,NA,NA,Units cannot be put on the street without backup from international security forces.
200411,61,61320,243,NA,NA,"This is a task we must do in partnership with other nations, not just on our own."
200411,61,61320,244,NA,NA,And this is a task in which we must succeed.
200411,61,61320,245,NA,NA,If we fail to create viable Iraqi security forces - military and police - there is no successful exit for us and other nations.
200411,61,61320,246,NA,NA,"The challenges in Iraq are great, but the opportunity is also significant."
200411,61,61320,247,NA,NA,"Under John Kerry and John Edwards, we will meet those challenges, win the peace in Iraq, and help to create new hope and opportunity for the entire Middle East."
200411,61,61320,249,NA,NA,U.S. engagement in Africa should reflect its vital significance to U.S. interests and the moral imperative to help a continent struggling with the scourge of HIV/AIDS and under the long shadow of chronic poverty.
200411,61,61320,250,NA,NA,The HIV/AIDS pandemic in southern and eastern Africa is a massive human tragedy.
200411,61,61320,251,NA,NA,It is also a security risk of the highest order that threatens to plunge nations into chaos.
200411,61,61320,252,NA,NA,Chronic and debilitating hunger also threatens the very survival of communities where investment in agriculture has suffered for over a decade.

200411,61,61320,326,NA,NA,But their version of transformation neglected to consider that the dangers we face have also been transformed.
200411,61,61320,327,NA,NA,"The Administration was concerned with fighting classic conventional wars, instead of the asymmetrical threats we now face in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war against al Qaeda."

200411,61,61320,334,NA,NA,"To pick up the slack, we've called up our Guard and Reserves at historic levels."
200411,61,61320,335,NA,NA,"Some have been on the ground in Iraq for as many as 15 months, much longer than was expected or promised."
200411,61,61320,336,NA,NA,Many of these units are being pushed to the limit and stretched far too thin.
200411,61,61320,337,NA,NA,The Administration's answer has just been to stretch further.
200411,61,61320,338,NA,NA,"They have extended tours of duty, delayed retirements, and prevented enlisted personnel from leaving the service - effectively using a stop-loss policy and recall of Individual Ready Reserve members as a back-door draft."
200411,61,61320,339,NA,NA,"We will add 40,000 new soldiers - not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts."

200411,61,61320,347,NA,NA,They also train local forces and build the relationships that are vital for our victory in the war on terror.
200411,61,61320,348,NA,NA,"We will increase our civil affairs personnel - those who arrive on the scene after the major conflict ends to work with local leaders and officials to get the schools back in shape, the hospitals reopened, and the banks up and running."
200411,61,61320,349,NA,NA,"We also need more military police, because public order is critical to establishing the conditions that allow peace to take hold."

200411,61,61320,352,NA,NA,We can't have a 21st century military unless we're using 21st century technology and preparing our forces for 21st century threats.

200411,61,61320,354,NA,NA,It also means employing the most sophisticated communications to help our troops prevail and protect themselves in battle.
200411,61,61320,355,NA,NA,Every soldier in every unit should have access to technology that can mean the difference between life and death.
200411,61,61320,356,NA,NA,We will make sure every solider does.
200411,61,61320,357,NA,NA,"And we will build and train new forces equipped with the most-sophisticated technology to specialize in finding, securing, and destroying weapons of mass destruction and the facilities that build them."
200411,61,61320,359,NA,NA,"Fourth, we must match our commitment to innovation with a commitment to the training, education, and facilities necessary to make the most of it."
200411,61,61320,361,NA,NA,"Fifth, we will make sure that America's commitment to the men and women of our armed forces (our active duty, our reservists, and our national guard) and their families is ironclad."
200411,61,61320,362,NA,NA,"We will enact a Military Family Bill of Rights to ensure that our men and women in uniform and their families receive the benefits and respect they deserve: competitive pay and quality housing, decent health care and dental care, quality education for their children, and timely deployment information."
200411,61,61320,363,NA,NA,And we will ensure that America will care for them and their families if the worst should happen.
200411,61,61320,365,NA,NA,"Finally, we need to make better use of a key asset in homeland defense - our National Guard."

200411,61,61320,378,NA,NA,This Administration let oil industry lobbyists and executives write our nation's energy policy in secret.
200411,61,61320,379,NA,NA,They even went to the Supreme Court to stop the public from learning what they were doing.
200411,61,61320,380,NA,NA,They've done nothing as gas prices have soared to record levels.
200411,61,61320,381,NA,NA,Even the Administration's own economists have found that their energy plan will do nothing to reduce gas prices.
200411,61,61320,382,NA,NA,"This President's approach to energy policy leaves America shackled to foreign oil, dependent, vulnerable, and exposed."

200411,61,61320,436,NA,NA,Millions of massive shipping containers arrive at American ports every year without being searched and without even a reliable list of their contents.

200411,61,61320,445,NA,NA,We need a new strategy for homeland security that addresses five major challenges.
200411,61,61320,446,NA,NA,"We need to improve our ability to gather, analyze, and share information so we can track down terrorists and stop them before they cause harm."
200411,61,61320,447,NA,NA,"We need to do a better job securing our airports, seaports, and borders."
200411,61,61320,448,NA,NA,We need to harden likely terrorist targets.
200411,61,61320,449,NA,NA,We need to improve domestic readiness.
200411,61,61320,450,NA,NA,"Finally, we must win the war on terror without losing the values of freedom and justice for all that make us so proud to be Americans."
200411,61,61320,452,NA,NA,The war on terror begins with good intelligence.
200411,61,61320,453,NA,NA,"Shockingly, many of the same flaws in intelligence-sharing that allowed terrorists to slip in and out of America before September 11th still exist."
200411,61,61320,454,NA,NA,"The government has missed its own deadlines for upgrading and integrating security databases, and still fails to share information with the state and local law enforcement agencies on the frontlines."
200411,61,61320,455,NA,NA,This must change.
200411,61,61320,456,NA,NA,We will ensure that our watch lists are accessible when and where they are needed.
200411,61,61320,457,NA,NA,We will also give security clearances to appropriate state and local officials so they can get critical information at the critical times.
200411,61,61320,458,NA,NA,"Our intelligence apparatus needs significant reform, and so creating a true Director of National Intelligence is critical."
200411,61,61320,460,NA,NA,We will improve security at our borders and entry-points to block the individuals and weapons that would harm us.
200411,61,61320,461,NA,NA,"We will strengthen container security rules, improve the detection equipment in our shipping systems, ensure that private companies are providing adequate information about the goods they are shipping, and work with other nations to increase inspection levels abroad."
200411,61,61320,462,NA,NA,"We will put an end to political delays in adopting tighter controls on air cargo, tons of which goes uninspected every day."
200411,61,61320,463,NA,NA,We will increase perimeter inspections at U.S airports and work with international aviation authorities to make sure the same standards are in place overseas.
200411,61,61320,464,NA,NA,"Working with our Northern and Southern neighbors, we will strengthen controls at border crossings, and use modern technology and better staffing to improve the quality of border inspections while enhancing commerce."
200411,61,61320,466,NA,NA,We will launch a major effort to harden our most vulnerable targets - from chemical and nuclear plants to rails and tunnels - and better protect them from attack.
200411,61,61320,467,NA,NA,Security upgrades at some nuclear weapons facilities are a shocking three years behind.
200411,61,61320,468,NA,NA,"That is unacceptable, and we will fix it."
200411,61,61320,469,NA,NA,We must better protect nuclear facilities and waste sites which today are too vulnerable to attack.
200411,61,61320,470,NA,NA,"We will improve transit rail and subway security, by adding chemical release detectors to deter attacks like we saw in Tokyo, and taking other steps."
200411,61,61320,471,NA,NA,"There are more than 100 chemical plants where an attack could endanger more than one million people, and the FBI has warned that al Qaeda may target our chemical industry."
200411,61,61320,472,NA,NA,The Bush Administration was actually moving toward a commonsense solution that would set minimum standards for safety at chemical plants.
200411,61,61320,473,NA,NA,"But dangerously true to form, after heavy lobbying by the chemical industry, they backed down."
200411,61,61320,474,NA,NA,"We will make these plants secure; by requiring more guards, more fencing, and the use of less dangerous chemicals when possible."
200411,61,61320,476,NA,NA,"We need to improve domestic readiness so people on the frontlines have the training and equipment to respond to any attack with all the speed, skill, and strength required."
200411,61,61320,477,NA,NA,"Our first responders are the first ones up the stairs in the event of the emergency, and it is wrong that today they are last in line when it comes to this administration's budgets."
200411,61,61320,478,NA,NA,"Under the Bush Administration, police departments in small cities have lost more than 15 percent of their full-time paid police and employees."
200411,61,61320,479,NA,NA,"And today, two-thirds of our nation's fire departments are not fully staffed."
200411,61,61320,480,NA,NA,We can do more for the heroes of 9/11 and we can do more for our fellow citizens.
200411,61,61320,481,NA,NA,And we will.
200411,61,61320,482,NA,NA,We will provide direct assistance to our police officers and firefighters on the frontlines.
200411,61,61320,483,NA,NA,They'll have the equipment and manpower they need to protect us.
200411,61,61320,484,NA,NA,We will also ensure that front line workers throughout our transportation system receive the security training necessary to respond to terrorist threats.
200411,61,61320,485,NA,NA,"We also need to modernize our emergency warning system to provide localized warnings, treat the fighters on the frontlines as partners, and give families all the information they need."
200411,61,61320,486,NA,NA,This Administration may think that homeland security is about changing the alert from yellow to orange.
200411,61,61320,487,NA,NA,"They're wrong; the colors of safety are firefighter red, EMT white, and police officer blue."
200411,61,61320,488,NA,NA,We will dramatically improve our ability to respond to a biological attack.
200411,61,61320,489,NA,NA,"We will appoint one individual to oversee all bioterrorism programs, budgets and strategic priorities."
200411,61,61320,490,NA,NA,We will set national benchmarks for state and local preparedness so community leaders aren't flying blind.
200411,61,61320,491,NA,NA,We will harness America's bioscience genius to increase drug and vaccine development.
200411,61,61320,492,NA,NA,"We will revitalize our public health system, improving monitoring capabilities and coordination."
200411,61,61320,493,NA,NA,"And we will strengthen hospitals, which today cannot prepare for a bio-terrorism emergency because they are overwhelmed by the everyday emergencies of people without insurance."
200411,61,61320,494,NA,NA,We also will encourage all Americans to do their part to make America safer.
200411,61,61320,495,NA,NA,We support the development of a new community defense service grounded in neighborhoods and comprised of ordinary Americans from across the country.
200411,61,61320,496,NA,NA,"Like a 21st Century Neighborhood Watch, members would work within their communities to make a contribution-helping health professionals, assisting with evacuation plans, and standing ready in emergency."
200411,61,61320,498,NA,NA,"While terrorism poses an especially menacing threat to our nation, a strong America must remain vigilant against the scourge of homegrown crime as well."
200411,61,61320,499,NA,NA,"We are proud that Democrats led the fight to put more than 100,000 cops on the beat through the COPS program, and we will continue our steadfast support for COPS and community policing."
200411,61,61320,500,NA,NA,"To keep our streets safe for our families, we support tough punishment of violent crime and smart efforts to reintegrate former prisoners into our communities as productive citizens."
200411,61,61320,501,NA,NA,"We will crack down on the gang violence and drug crime that devastate so many communities, and we will increase drug treatment, including mandatory drug courts and mandatory drug testing for parolees and probationers, so fewer crimes are committed in the first place."
200411,61,61320,502,NA,NA,"We support the rights of victims to be respected, to be heard, and to be compensated."
200411,61,61320,503,NA,NA,We will help break the cycle of domestic violence by punishing offenders and standing with victims.
200411,61,61320,504,NA,NA,"We will protect Americans' Second Amendment right to own firearms, and we will keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists by fighting gun crime, reauthorizing the assault weapons ban, and closing the gun show loophole, as President Bush proposed and failed to do."
200411,61,61320,506,NA,NA,We must always remember that terrorists do not just target our lives; they target our way of life.
200411,61,61320,507,NA,NA,And so we must be on constant guard not to sacrifice the freedom we are fighting to protect.
200411,61,61320,508,NA,NA,"We will strengthen some provisions of the Patriot Act, like the restrictions on money laundering."
200411,61,61320,509,NA,NA,"And we will change the portions of the Patriot Act that threaten individual rights, such as the library provisions, while still allowing government to take all needed steps to fight terror."
200411,61,61320,510,NA,NA,"Our government should never round up innocent people only because of their religion or ethnicity, and we should never stifle free expression."
200411,61,61320,511,NA,NA,We believe in an America where freedom is what we fight for - not what we give up.
200411,61,61320,512,NA,NA,"Together, we can make America safer, stronger, and more respected."

200411,61,61320,516,NA,NA,"We can do it in a way that keeps faith with the best measures of American leadership around the world - the builder of alliances, the defender of freedom, the champion of human rights."

200411,61,61320,528,NA,NA,That's the America we believe in.
200411,61,61320,529,NA,NA,That's the America we're fighting for.

200411,61,61320,531,NA,NA,"In President George Bush's America, unfortunately, too often you need special privileges if you want opportunity."
200411,61,61320,532,NA,NA,"This White House values wealth over hard work, lavishes special treatment upon a fortunate few at the expense of most businesses and working people, and defends policies that weaken America's competitive position and destroy American jobs."

200411,61,61320,733,NA,NA,"John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democratic Party believe in a better, stronger, healthier America."
200411,61,61320,734,NA,NA,Our resolve to fix the health crisis is stronger than ever.
200411,61,61320,735,NA,NA,"In the wealthiest country in the world, every expectant mother should get quality prenatal care; every child should get regular check-ups; every senior should be able to get safe, affordable prescription drugs; and no hard-working family should ever lose everything because illness strikes a loved one."
200411,61,61320,737,NA,NA,The job begins with our children.
200411,61,61320,738,NA,NA,It is a disgrace that nearly 8. 5 million children still lack health insurance.
200411,61,61320,739,NA,NA,We will strengthen Medicaid for our families and expand the children's health program created under President Clinton so no child goes without medical care.
200411,61,61320,741,NA,NA,"Under the leadership of John Kerry and John Edwards, we will offer individuals and businesses tax credits to make quality, reliable health coverage more affordable."
200411,61,61320,742,NA,NA,"We will provide tax credits to Americans who are approaching retirement age and those who are between jobs so they can afford quality, reliable coverage."
200411,61,61320,743,NA,NA,We will expand coverage for low income adults through existing federal-state health care programs.
200411,61,61320,744,NA,NA,And we will provide all Americans with access to the same coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
200411,61,61320,746,NA,NA,At the center of our efforts will be a plan to reduce health costs.
200411,61,61320,747,NA,NA,"We will lift a financial burden on families, businesses, and the self-employed by picking up the tab for the highest-cost medical cases."
200411,61,61320,748,NA,NA,"That will save America's families up to $1,000 on their premiums."
200411,61,61320,749,NA,NA,We will improve the quality of care and the efficiency of the medical system by using American technological know-how to cut billions of dollars wasted in administrative processing and paperwork.
200411,61,61320,750,NA,NA,"Today, about a quarter of all health-related spending is not even medical."
200411,61,61320,751,NA,NA,We can do better.
200411,61,61320,752,NA,NA,"We will ensure that all Americans have secure, private electronic medical records by 2008, and we will give medical providers incentives and resources to simplify their paperwork so patients spend more time with doctors and less time filling out forms."
200411,61,61320,753,NA,NA,We recognize that our health care system is substantially strengthened by the daily efforts of the men and women in a variety of health professions and we support fair treatment for all health professionals.
200411,61,61320,754,NA,NA,We will enact a real Patient's Bill of Rights to put doctors and nurses back in charge of making medical decisions with their patients - instead of allowing HMO bureaucrats to decide what a patient needs.
200411,61,61320,756,NA,NA,We oppose privatizing Medicare.
200411,61,61320,757,NA,NA,We will not allow Republicans to destroy a commitment that has done so much good for so many seniors and people with disabilities over the past 39 years.

200411,61,61320,761,NA,NA,"Today, our seniors are paying too much for prescription drugs, while options abroad are far cheaper and just as safe."
200411,61,61320,762,NA,NA,We will allow the safe reimportation of drugs from other countries.
200411,61,61320,763,NA,NA,The current Medicare drug program serves drug companies more than seniors.
200411,61,61320,764,NA,NA,It allows these companies to change the price of prescriptions more frequently than seniors can change their plans.
200411,61,61320,765,NA,NA,It does virtually nothing to bring down prescription drug costs.
200411,61,61320,766,NA,NA,It forces seniors into HMOs.
200411,61,61320,767,NA,NA,Elderly Americans deserve a real prescription drug benefit - one that uses the government's purchasing power to lower costs and ensures access to new therapies for their illnesses.
200411,61,61320,768,NA,NA,"We will cut the waste and abuse that cost Medicare billions each year, using competitive bidding to lower the costs of buying medical equipment, educating providers to file claims more efficiently, and increasing penalties for those who bilk the system."
200411,61,61320,770,NA,NA,"We will ensure that elderly Americans and people with disabilities can live in dignity, with quality options for long-term care."
200411,61,61320,771,NA,NA,We need to expand alternative care options and provide better assistance for those who give care.
200411,61,61320,772,NA,NA,No one should be kept in a nursing home or institution if they prefer living in dignity elsewhere and can do so.

200411,61,61320,774,NA,NA,"We will also work to ensure that people with HIV and AIDS have the care they need, and we will support the community-based prevention programs, built on experience with real life, that President Bush has cut."

200411,61,61320,784,NA,NA,We will push the boundaries of science in search of new medical therapies and cures.
200411,61,61320,785,NA,NA,"The Bush Administration has put ideology over science, skewing information about everything from women's health to scientific research."
200411,61,61320,786,NA,NA,"Americans deserve access to the best evidence available about illnesses, therapies, and cures."
200411,61,61320,787,NA,NA,"From new therapies to prolong life for people with AIDS, to new openings in the battle to cure cancer, the possibilities of medical research fill us with hope."
200411,61,61320,788,NA,NA,We will secure more funding for aggressive biomedical research seeking affordable and effective therapies based on real science.
200411,61,61320,789,NA,NA,"President Bush has rejected the calls from Nancy Reagan, Christopher Reeve and Americans across the land for assistance with embryonic stem cell research."
200411,61,61320,790,NA,NA,We will reverse his wrongheaded policy.
200411,61,61320,791,NA,NA,Stem cell therapy offers hope to more than 100 million Americans who have serious illnesses - from Alzheimer's to heart disease to juvenile diabetes to Parkinson's.
200411,61,61320,792,NA,NA,"We will pursue this research under the strictest ethical guidelines, but we will not walk away from the chance to save lives and reduce human suffering."
200411,61,61320,794,NA,NA,"Finally, we will never forget the debt America owes our veterans."
200411,61,61320,795,NA,NA,Patriotism means keeping faith with those who have worn the uniform of the United States.
200411,61,61320,796,NA,NA,This Administration has broken its promises to our veterans - raising their health costs and reducing their access to care.
200411,61,61320,797,NA,NA,"John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democrats will keep faith with our veterans."
200411,61,61320,798,NA,NA,We will continue the fight for mandatory funding for veterans' health care and we will make sure that disabled veterans and military retirees are not penalized with reductions in their pension benefits.
200411,61,61320,799,NA,NA,And we will aggressively address the inexcusable backlogs in veterans' compensation and pension claims.
200411,61,61320,800,NA,NA,We believe in an America where health care is available and affordable.
200411,61,61320,801,NA,NA,"Where every family looks to the future with hope and excitement, without worry that the cost of health care is becoming too great to bear."

200411,61,61320,804,NA,NA,The simple bargain at the heart of the American Dream offers opportunity to every American who takes the responsibility to make the most of it.
200411,61,61320,805,NA,NA,"That bargain is the great source of American strength, because it unleashes the amazing talent and determination of our people."
200411,61,61320,806,NA,NA,"And as our people seize the opportunity to build a better life, they build a stronger country."

200411,61,61320,811,NA,NA,"So we believe in an America that offers the best education to all our children - wherever they live, whatever their background."
200411,61,61320,812,NA,NA,Period.
200411,61,61320,813,NA,NA,We believe in an America where every child comes to school ready to learn.
200411,61,61320,814,NA,NA,"Where every student is held to high standards, and every school has the resources and responsibility to meet those standards."
200411,61,61320,815,NA,NA,"Where every classroom has a great teacher, and every student gets enough personal attention to foster a talent or overcome a difficulty."
200411,61,61320,816,NA,NA,We believe in an America where every teenager completes a rigorous high school curriculum.
200411,61,61320,817,NA,NA,Where every qualified young person who wants to go to college can afford it.
200411,61,61320,818,NA,NA,And where every adult who needs additional job training can get it.
200411,61,61320,819,NA,NA,"In President George Bush's America, our government ignores the shameful truth that the quality of a child's education depends on the wealth of that child's neighborhood."
200411,61,61320,820,NA,NA,"Our best public schools are the best schools in the world, but too many children go to schools that just don't work."
200411,61,61320,821,NA,NA,Too many children who beat the odds and succeed in school can't afford to go on to college.
200411,61,61320,822,NA,NA,And too many adults who need added training aren't able to get it.
200411,61,61320,823,NA,NA,"For this White House, education is an easy promise - easy come, and easy go."
200411,61,61320,824,NA,NA,"When President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act, he said the right things - asking more from our schools and pledging to give them the resources to get the job done."
200411,61,61320,825,NA,NA,"And then he promptly broke his word, providing schools $27 billion less than he had promised, literally leaving millions of children behind."
200411,61,61320,826,NA,NA,The President also gets a failing grade for higher education.
200411,61,61320,827,NA,NA,"Over the last three years, college tuitions have risen by 35 percent, pricing 220,000 students out of college."
200411,61,61320,828,NA,NA,"Yet while then-Governor Bush promised to increase college aid, President Bush tried to charge more for student loans and eliminate Pell Grants for 84,000 students."
200411,61,61320,829,NA,NA,"John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democratic Party believe that a strong America begins at home with strong families, and that strong families need the best schools."
200411,61,61320,830,NA,NA,"We believe schools must teach fundamental skills like math and science, and fundamental values like citizenship and responsibility."
200411,61,61320,831,NA,NA,"We believe providing resources without reform is a waste of money, and reform without resources is a waste of time."
200411,61,61320,832,NA,NA,And we believe politicians who expect students to learn responsibility should start by keeping their own promises.
200411,61,61320,834,NA,NA,"Under John Kerry and John Edwards, we will offer high quality early learning opportunities, smaller classes, more after school activities, and more individualized attention for our students, particularly students with special needs, gifts, and talents."

200411,61,61320,839,NA,NA,"We need to do more to attract and retain teachers, more to encourage their excellence, and more to ensure that all teachers are offering high-quality teaching."
200411,61,61320,840,NA,NA,"We must raise pay for teachers, especially in the schools and subjects where great teachers are in the shortest supply."
200411,61,61320,841,NA,NA,"We must improve mentoring, professional development, and new technology training for teachers, instead of leaving them to sink or swim."
200411,61,61320,842,NA,NA,"At the same time, we must create rigorous new incentives and tests for new teachers."
200411,61,61320,843,NA,NA,We need new rewards for teachers who go the extra mile and excel in helping children learn.
200411,61,61320,844,NA,NA,"And teachers deserve due process protection from arbitrary dismissal, but we must have fast, fair procedures for improving or removing teachers who do not perform on the job."
200411,61,61320,845,NA,NA,"Parents are our children's first and most important teachers, and they have a responsibility to participate in their children's education."
200411,61,61320,846,NA,NA,"We will help them do so by offering information and resources to better teach their children, whether reminding them about homework or attending a parent-teacher conference."
200411,61,61320,848,NA,NA,Vast achievement gaps persist in America.
200411,61,61320,849,NA,NA,"Nearly half of African-American, Latino, and American Indian youth don't graduate high school."
200411,61,61320,850,NA,NA,We believe in the potential of every child and we will not accept this loss of talent.
200411,61,61320,851,NA,NA,"Because education in the earliest years of a child's life is critical, we will expand and improve preschool and Head Start initiatives with the goal of offering these opportunities to all children."
200411,61,61320,852,NA,NA,"Because children need safe, loving, and disciplined homes in order to learn, we will work on a bipartisan basis to reform foster care."
200411,61,61320,853,NA,NA,"And we will undertake a national campaign to raise graduation rates by raising student achievement, expecting more from schools, reaching out to troubled youth with mentoring and tutoring, and strengthening the basic high school curriculum."
200411,61,61320,854,NA,NA,"We will meet these challenges together-parents, teachers, principals, educational support professionals and paraprofessionals, along with universities, community-based and faith-based organizations."
200411,61,61320,856,NA,NA,"We will use testing to advance real learning, not undermine it, by developing high-quality assessments that measure the complex skills students need to develop."
200411,61,61320,857,NA,NA,"We will make sure that federal law operates with high standards and common sense, not just bureaucratic rigidity."
200411,61,61320,858,NA,NA,"Instead of pushing private school vouchers that funnel scarce dollars away from the public schools, we will support public school choice, including charter schools and magnet schools that meet the same high standards as other schools."
200411,61,61320,859,NA,NA,"And at a time when so many schools charged with our future are relics of the past, we will build new schools and offer the technology and equipment for a 21st century education."
200411,61,61320,861,NA,NA,"With the leadership of John Kerry and John Edwards, we will make college more affordable, so that more young people get higher education, and more of those who graduate get relief from the crushing burden of debt."
200411,61,61320,862,NA,NA,We will make student aid faster and simpler to get so students aren't scared off by the complicated process.
200411,61,61320,863,NA,NA,"We will offer generous tax credits to reduce the price of four years of college for all students, including those who pay their own way and can least afford college now."
200411,61,61320,864,NA,NA,We will strengthen our aid programs for students while eliminating wasteful subsidies for lenders.
200411,61,61320,865,NA,NA,"At a time when all good jobs increasingly depend on advanced skills, we will strengthen technical training for those who do not attend college."
200411,61,61320,866,NA,NA,"Finally, we must place a special emphasis on expanding achievement in math and science."
200411,61,61320,867,NA,NA,These are subjects where America has always led the world and must continue to lead in the 21st century.
200411,61,61320,869,NA,NA,We must remain committed to the moral and civic dimensions of education.
200411,61,61320,870,NA,NA,Education requires the engagement of the whole community in order to teach the whole child.
200411,61,61320,871,NA,NA,"Students should learn responsibility in our schools, and students who are irresponsible-using drugs or bringing violence into schools-must face strict discipline."
200411,61,61320,872,NA,NA,We should support character education in our elementary and secondary schools and community service as a condition of graduation from high schools.

200411,61,61320,878,NA,NA,"For generations, Americans of all political beliefs have understood that the protection of our environment and the stewardship of our land are vital to the strength of our nation."

200411,61,61320,880,NA,NA,"The health of our families, the strength of our economy, and the well-being of our world all depend upon a clean environment."
200411,61,61320,881,NA,NA,"But in President George Bush's government, where polluters actually write environmental laws and oil company profits matter more than hard science and cold facts, protecting the environment doesn't matter at all."
200411,61,61320,882,NA,NA,"Even though 133 million Americans already live with unhealthy air, the Bush Administration bowed to energy industry lobbying and rewrote rules to allow 20,000 facilities to spew more smog, soot, and mercury into the air."
200411,61,61320,883,NA,NA,"Even though public water systems in many cities are polluted, they have taken environmental cops off the beat and pushed to allow more arsenic in our water."
200411,61,61320,884,NA,NA,"Even though the President promised more than five billion dollars for our national parks, he has delivered a fraction of that, leaving trails closed, historic structures collapsing, and our parks losing luster."
200411,61,61320,885,NA,NA,"And even though overwhelming scientific evidence shows that global climate change is a scientific fact, this administration has rewritten government reports to hide that fact."

200411,61,61620,1073,NA,NA,"But due to the lack of indexing, the broad base and reach of the current AMT will make it apply increasingly to middle-income taxpayers."
200411,61,61620,1074,NA,NA,Millions of additional taxpayers must complete AMT forms just to determine that they are not subject to the tax.
200411,61,61620,1075,NA,NA,"As we look at the broader issue of tax reform, we call upon Congress to address this increasingly unfair second tax system on hardworking Americans."
200411,61,61620,1077,NA,NA,"To make sure the private sector has the capital it needs to invest, grow the economy, and expand prosperity, our leaders must make sure that the growth of the federal government remains in check."
200411,61,61620,1078,NA,NA,The challenges America has faced over the last four years have created an unwelcome but manageable budget deficit.
200411,61,61620,1079,NA,NA,These deficits are due to a number of factors: the stock market downturn that began in 2000 and the subsequent recession that President Bush inherited when he took office; the terrorist attacks on America and the necessary spending for homeland security and the War on Terror those attacks precipitated; and the crisis in confidence produced by corporate scandals that were years in the making.
200411,61,61620,1080,NA,NA,It is important to view the size of the deficit in relation to the size of the nation's economy.
200411,61,61620,1081,NA,NA,"By that measure, today's deficit, although unwelcome, is well within historical ranges."
200411,61,61620,1082,NA,NA,"A deficit that is 3. 8 percent of GDP, as is now projected for this year, would be smaller than the deficits in nine of the last 25 years, and far below the peak deficit figure of 6 percent of GDP reached in 1983."
200411,61,61620,1083,NA,NA,This deficit is also in line with what other industrialized nations are facing today.
200411,61,61620,1084,NA,NA,"The U. S. deficit matches the average deficit within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and is below the levels of France, Germany, and Japan."
200411,61,61620,1085,NA,NA,"Much more importantly, because the President and Congress enacted pro-growth economic policies, the deficit is headed strongly in the right direction."
200411,61,61620,1086,NA,NA,"Next year's projected deficit, at 2. 7 percent of GDP, would be smaller than those in 14 of the last 25 years."
200411,61,61620,1087,NA,NA,"As Republicans in Congress work with the President to restrain spending and strengthen economic growth, the federal deficit will fall to 1. 5 percent of the nation's economic output in 2009 - well below the 2. 2 percent average of the last 40 years."
200411,61,61620,1088,NA,NA,The events that brought us into deficit are not completely behind us.
200411,61,61620,1089,NA,NA,The War on Terror goes on.
200411,61,61620,1090,NA,NA,"The recession has passed, but some industries and workers are still feeling its effects."
200411,61,61620,1091,NA,NA,"Republicans are committed to winning the War on Terror and will continue to implement policies that promote jobs, investment, and growth in every region of the country and every sector of our economy."
200411,61,61620,1092,NA,NA,"Let us be clear: If government is to meet the most pressing needs of our time and still maintain fiscal discipline, government leaders must set priorities and stick with them."
200411,61,61620,1093,NA,NA,President Bush has shown genuine leadership in doing just that.
200411,61,61620,1094,NA,NA,"Time and again, he has made difficult decisions and followed through with clear determination."
200411,61,61620,1095,NA,NA,He has made it plain that his top budgetary priority is to protect America and win the War on Terror.
200411,61,61620,1096,NA,NA,He also remains committed to the education reforms he spearheaded in 2001.
200411,61,61620,1097,NA,NA,All discretionary spending must be kept in check and taxes must remain low to stimulate economic growth.
200411,61,61620,1098,NA,NA,We endorse the President's pro-growth economic policies and his disciplined approach to spending taxpayers' dollars.
200411,61,61620,1099,NA,NA,And we applaud the efforts of President Bush and Republicans in Congress to meet our nation's priorities and cut the deficit by more than half within five years.
200411,61,61620,1101,NA,NA,Tax cuts and spending are not the same.
200411,61,61620,1102,NA,NA,They do not have the same effect on the economy or on the federal budget.
200411,61,61620,1103,NA,NA,"Tax cuts allow American workers, families, business owners, and investors to keep more of their own money."
200411,61,61620,1104,NA,NA,New spending requires the government to take control of a bigger slice of the economy.
200411,61,61620,1105,NA,NA,We recognize that the problem is not that the American people are taxed too little but that the federal government spends too much.
200411,61,61620,1106,NA,NA,"To ensure that the federal government respects the burdens on taxpayers and spends only as much as is necessary to accomplish our common goals, we support extending the pay-as-you-go requirement for mandatory spending only."
200411,61,61620,1108,NA,NA,Spending limits will help Congress restrain the growth of government.
200411,61,61620,1109,NA,NA,We support a cap on discretionary spending that will limit the growth of overall spending while ensuring that priorities such as our nation's security will continue to be met.
200411,61,61620,1110,NA,NA,"We applaud President Bush for submitting a budget for 2005 that provides significant increases in funding to win the War on Terror and protect the homeland, while limiting the growth in all other non-security related discretionary spending to less than one percent."
200411,61,61620,1112,NA,NA,"To further the goal of respecting taxpayers' dollars and restraining spending, we endorse the creation of a line-item veto, which the President could use consistent with the Constitution to reject new appropriations, new mandatory spending, or limited grants of tax benefits (to 100 or fewer beneficiaries) whenever he determines the spending or tax benefits are not essential priorities."
200411,61,61620,1113,NA,NA,"Under this approach, all savings from the line-item veto would be used for deficit reduction, and could not be applied to other spending."
200411,61,61620,1114,NA,NA,Governors across the nation already have and use this tool to reduce unnecessary spending.
200411,61,61620,1115,NA,NA,The President should have the same option.
200411,61,61620,1117,NA,NA,It is often said that a government program is the closest man has come to achieving immortality.
200411,61,61620,1118,NA,NA,"Government programs are designed with specific purposes, and they ought to be assessed to determine whether they are meeting their goals."
200411,61,61620,1119,NA,NA,"We endorse creating a commission to evaluate discretionary spending on federal agencies and programs to ensure that taxpayer funds are being used for the best, most efficient purposes."
200411,61,61620,1120,NA,NA,"Such a commission would determine whether certain programs are duplicative, wasteful or inefficient, outdated or irrelevant, or failed."
200411,61,61620,1121,NA,NA,"It would recommend to Congress programs that could be terminated, moved, or restructured to make the government more efficient."
200411,61,61620,1123,NA,NA,New government programs are frequently created with little review of programs that already exist to address the same perceived problem.
200411,61,61620,1124,NA,NA,"Over time, numerous programs with overlapping missions and competing agendas grow up alongside one another - wasting money and baffling citizens."
200411,61,61620,1125,NA,NA,"We support President Bush's vision for government reform, which is guided by three principles."
200411,61,61620,1126,NA,NA,"Government should be: citizen-centered, not bureaucracy-centered; results-oriented; and market-based, actively promoting rather than stifling innovation through competition."
200411,61,61620,1127,NA,NA,"The President's management agenda is an effective tool for making sure government is active but limited, focusing on results and obtaining them efficiently."
200411,61,61620,1129,NA,NA,"The Republican Party respects and appreciates the private sector as the primary creator of jobs, economic growth, opportunity, and prosperity in our society."

200411,61,61620,1131,NA,NA,"When corporate leaders break the law, they should be punished."
200411,61,61620,1132,NA,NA,"After fraudulent corporate practices rooted in the irrational exuberance of the late 1990s began to surface in the closing months of 2001, President Bush worked with the Congress to take decisive action to restore honesty and integrity to America's corporate boardrooms."
200411,61,61620,1133,NA,NA,"In July 2002, President Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the most farreaching reform of American business practices since the 1940s."
200411,61,61620,1134,NA,NA,"Under this new law, CEOs and Chief Financial Officers are required to personally vouch for the truth and fairness of their companies' disclosures; for the first time, an independent board has been established to oversee the accounting profession; investigators have been given new tools to root out corporate fraud; and enhanced penalties are ensuring that dishonest corporate officials do hard time."
200411,61,61620,1135,NA,NA,We applaud President Bush for vigorously enforcing the law to deter and punish further corporate abuses.
200411,61,61620,1136,NA,NA,He established an interagency Corporate Fraud Task Force to investigate and prosecute financial crimes; to recover the proceeds of those crimes; and to hold corporate criminals to account.
200411,61,61620,1137,NA,NA,"Since the Task Force was established two years ago, over 700 violators have been charged and over 300 convictions or guilty pleas secured, including more than 25 former CEOs."

200411,61,61620,1142,NA,NA,"International trade has become the world's most powerful economic force, and Americans are seeing great benefits from free and fair trade."
200411,61,61620,1143,NA,NA,Exports accounted for about 25 percent of the economic growth in the 1990s and supported about 12 million jobs.
200411,61,61620,1144,NA,NA,An additional 6 million jobs are made possible by companies based in foreign countries investing here in the United States.
200411,61,61620,1145,NA,NA,"Consumers have benefited - recent trade agreements save the average family of four $2000 per year by lowering regulatory barriers, eliminating tariffs, and providing more consumer choices."
200411,61,61620,1146,NA,NA,Free trade must be fair trade that advances America's economic goals and protects American jobs.
200411,61,61620,1147,NA,NA,"To achieve this goal, we must act globally, regionally, and bilaterally to negotiate new trade agreements and enforce existing trade commitments."
200411,61,61620,1148,NA,NA,"We must be at the table when trade agreements are negotiated, make the interests of American workers and farmers paramount, and ensure that the drive to open new markets is successful."

200411,61,61620,1153,NA,NA,In 2000 we resolved to renew Trade Promotion Authority so the President could more easily negotiate trade agreements.
200411,61,61620,1154,NA,NA,In 2002 President Bush and Republicans in Congress did exactly that.
200411,61,61620,1155,NA,NA,"After lapsing for eight years, the law now allows President Bush to work with other countries to reduce barriers to our products and services."

200411,61,61620,1161,NA,NA,"•The Administration has also made significant progress in negotiating multi-lateral trade agreements, having just last month revived World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations for the final phase of the Doha round."
200411,61,61620,1162,NA,NA,"• The revival of these negotiations opens the door to lower tariffs on consumer and industrial goods, reductions in tariffs and trade-distorting export subsidies on agricultural products, and market access and lower regulatory barriers for services."
200411,61,61620,1163,NA,NA,The vitality of the U.S. trade agenda depends upon the vigorous enforcement of U.S. trade laws against unfair competition.
200411,61,61620,1164,NA,NA,"We will not tolerate foreign practices, rules, and subsidization that put our exports and manufacturers on an unequal footing."
200411,61,61620,1165,NA,NA,It is not enough to secure signatures on a piece of paper; our trading partners must follow through on the promises they make.
200411,61,61620,1166,NA,NA,"As part of its trade enforcement efforts, the Bush Administration has imposed more anti-dumping orders on average each year than the previous Administration."
200411,61,61620,1167,NA,NA,The United States was the first country in the world to impose a safeguard action against Chinese textile and apparel imports and to file a case against China in the WTO.

200411,61,61620,1173,NA,NA,Junk and frivolous lawsuits are driving up the cost of doing business in America by forcing companies to pay excessive legal expenses to fight off or settle often baseless lawsuits.
200411,61,61620,1174,NA,NA,"Those costs are being paid by small business owners, manufacturers, their employees, and consumers."
200411,61,61620,1175,NA,NA,"A typical small business with $10 million in annual revenue pays about $150,000 a year in tort liability costs."

200411,61,61620,1195,NA,NA,Clearly the financial problems plaguing Amtrak cannot be solved simply by continued infusions of taxpayer dollars.

200411,61,61620,1375,NA,NA,Shifting the cost-burden onto the federal or state governments - costs that will ultimately be borne by the taxpayers - is not an effective solution to the problem.

200411,61,61620,1377,NA,NA,It is also important that we reaffirm our Party's firm rejection of any measure aimed at making health care a government-run enterprise.
200411,61,61620,1379,NA,NA,We support legislation to enable small employers to pool together to offer health insurance options to their employees.

200411,61,61620,1388,NA,NA,"Junk lawsuits add at least $60 billion to health care costs in America because doctors are forced to practice defensive medicine, ordering extensive, unnecessary, and expensive tests and procedures to keep trial lawyers at bay."

201211,61,61320,51,NA,NA,These values are why we enacted historic health care reform that provides economic security for families

201211,61,61320,986,NA,NA,including the danger posed by international terrorist organizations that threaten the American homeland.
201211,61,61320,987,NA,NA,"As the Bush administration shifted its focus to Iraq, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda established safe havens across the border from Afghanistan, in Pakistan."
201211,61,61320,988,NA,NA,President Obama’s decision to end the Iraq war freed up military and intelligence resources to refocus on this fight
201211,61,61320,989,NA,NA,and enabled us to shift to a much more effective approach to counterterrorism.
201211,61,61320,990,NA,NA,"Importantly, President Obama also shifted away from the Bush administration’s sweeping and internationally-divisive rhetoric of a “global war on terrorism”"
201211,61,61320,991,NA,NA,to a more focused effort against an identifiable network of people: al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
201211,61,61320,992,NA,NA,That has allowed us to target force with greater precision against those who want to harm Americans and attack the United States
201211,61,61320,993,NA,NA,and move away from the type of large-scale military deployments characteristic of the previous administration and favored by many Republicans today.
201211,61,61320,994,NA,NA,"As a candidate, then-Senator Obama committed to bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, even if that meant crossing the border into Pakistan."
201211,61,61320,995,NA,NA,"As a consequence of the President’s decisions and the brave work of our military and intelligence professionals, bin Laden can no longer threaten the United States and al-Qaeda’s senior leadership has been devastated, rendering the group far less capable than it was four years ago."
201211,61,61320,996,NA,NA,The al-Qaeda core in Afghanistan and Pakistan has never been weaker.
201211,61,61320,997,NA,NA,We have also struck blows against al-Qaeda’s leadership in Yemen and Somalia – with the full support and close cooperation of those governments.
201211,61,61320,998,NA,NA,"At the same time, the President and the Democratic Party understand that we must stay vigilant."
201211,61,61320,999,NA,NA,"The al-Qaeda core may be on the path to defeat, but the organization and its affiliates remain active in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and elsewhere."
201211,61,61320,1000,NA,NA,"For that reason, we are committed to an unrelenting pursuit of those who would kill Americans or threaten our homeland, our allies, our partners, and our interests around the world."
201211,61,61320,1002,NA,NA,The United States went into Afghanistan after 9/11 to bring justice to those who had attacked us and to take away al-Qaeda’s safe haven.
201211,61,61320,1003,NA,NA,"But by the time President Obama took office, we had lost sight of those goals."
201211,61,61320,1004,NA,NA,"So the President refocused our efforts there in 2009, setting the clear goal of defeating al-Qaeda and denying it an ability to reestablish a safe haven in Afghanistan."
201211,61,61320,1005,NA,NA,"Because of the deteriorating security situation, he sent additional resources to reverse the Taliban’s momentum and to give the Afghans the time and space to build the capacity of their security forces."
201211,61,61320,1006,NA,NA,"We have accomplished that, and now we have begun the process of bringing our troops home from Afghanistan, including removing 33,000 by September 2012."
201211,61,61320,1007,NA,NA,"And, with the support of our allies, the President has outlined a plan to end the war in Afghanistan in 2014."
201211,61,61320,1008,NA,NA,"Already, the United States and our North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have begun to transition responsibility to Afghan security forces."
201211,61,61320,1009,NA,NA,"At the same time, we are keeping up the pressure on the Taliban,"
201211,61,61320,1010,NA,NA,"pursuing the possibility of a political resolution to parts of the conflict,"
201211,61,61320,1011,NA,NA,and continuing our capacity-building efforts.

201211,61,61320,1014,NA,NA,"More broadly, we will also continue to support peace and stability in South Asia."
201211,61,61320,1015,NA,NA,Pakistan can be a partner in that process.
201211,61,61320,1016,NA,NA,"The United States will make clear that we respect Pakistan’s sovereignty and democratic institutions,"
201211,61,61320,1017,NA,NA,and that our interest is in putting an end to al-Qaeda’s safe havens and respecting Afghan sovereignty.
201211,61,61320,1018,NA,NA,"Mitt Romney has been both for and against our timeline to end the war in Afghanistan,"
201211,61,61320,1019,NA,NA,"but he has failed to outline any policy ideas for how he would bring our troops home and, at times, has suggested he would leave them there indefinitely."
201211,61,61320,1021,NA,NA,"In our continuing efforts to keep America safe, President Obama and the Democratic Party believe we must address the threat that nuclear weapons pose to our security and to peace in the world."
201211,61,61320,1022,NA,NA,"Despite the two decades that have passed since the end of the Cold War, large stockpiles of nuclear weapons persist, and more nations are interested in acquiring them."
201211,61,61320,1023,NA,NA,Nuclear testing and black-market trade in sensitive nuclear materials continue.
201211,61,61320,1024,NA,NA,"And terrorists remain determined to buy, build, or steal the ultimate weapon."
201211,61,61320,1025,NA,NA,President Obama and the Democratic Party are committed to preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons
201211,61,61320,1026,NA,NA,and to eventually ridding the planet of these catastrophic weapons.
201211,61,61320,1027,NA,NA,This goal will not be achieved overnight.
201211,61,61320,1028,NA,NA,"It will require patience, perseverance, and the steady accumulation of concrete actions."
201211,61,61320,1029,NA,NA,But real progress has already been made.
201211,61,61320,1030,NA,NA,"Reducing Nuclear Weapons Stockpiles. The Obama administration has moved away from Cold War thinking by reducing the prominence of nuclear weapons in America’s national security strategy, and it has urged others to do the same."
201211,61,61320,1031,NA,NA,"As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal to deter any adversary and guarantee the defense of our allies."
201211,61,61320,1032,NA,NA,But President Obama has taken important steps to decrease America’s nuclear arsenal and is committed to further responsible reductions.
201211,61,61320,1033,NA,NA,"To reduce our warheads and stockpile, lower the threat of a nuclear exchange, and lay the foundation for future progress, President Obama negotiated and signed the landmark New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia,"
201211,61,61320,1034,NA,NA,producing cuts in each side’s deployed nuclear stockpiles and launchers and allowing us to monitor and verify Russia’s arsenal.
201211,61,61320,1035,NA,NA,"Yet despite bipartisan consensus among former National Security Advisors, Secretaries of Defense, and Secretaries of State that New START makes America safer, Mitt Romney strongly objected to the treaty."
201211,61,61320,1036,NA,NA,"Moving forward, the President will work with Russia to achieve additional reductions in stockpiles and nuclear delivery vehicles, including tactical and non-deployed nuclear weapons."
201211,61,61320,1037,NA,NA,We will also work to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
201211,61,61320,1038,NA,NA,and seek a new Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty that prohibits the production of fissile materials intended for use in nuclear weapons.
201211,61,61320,1039,NA,NA,Preventing Nuclear Proliferation. President Obama and the Democratic Party are also committed to strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the bedrock of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries.
201211,61,61320,1040,NA,NA,"As we work to uphold our obligations under the treaty by reducing stockpiles and recognizing the rights of all rule-abiding states to peaceful nuclear energy,"
201211,61,61320,1041,NA,NA,"we will insist that countries without nuclear weapons comply with their obligations not to develop them,"
201211,61,61320,1042,NA,NA,and we will ensure that violators face real consequences.
201211,61,61320,1043,NA,NA,"Iran. President Obama, working closely with our international partners and Congress, has put in place unprecedented sanctions against Iran."
201211,61,61320,1044,NA,NA,"Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon, but has continually failed to meet its obligations under the NPT and several United Nations Security Council resolutions,"
201211,61,61320,1045,NA,NA,and it cannot demonstrate with any credibility that its program is peaceful.
201211,61,61320,1046,NA,NA,The President is committed to using all instruments of national power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
201211,61,61320,1047,NA,NA,"When President Obama took office, Iran was ascendant in the region, and the international community was divided over how to address Iran’s nuclear violations."
201211,61,61320,1048,NA,NA,The President’s early offer of engagement with Iran – quickly rebuffed by the regime – allowed the United States to expose Iranian intransigence and rally the international community as never before.
201211,61,61320,1049,NA,NA,"Working with our European allies and with Russia and China, the administration gained unprecedented agreement for the toughest ever UN sanctions against Iran,"
201211,61,61320,1050,NA,NA,laying the foundation for additional national financial and energy sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations.
201211,61,61320,1051,NA,NA,"As a result, Iran is now increasingly isolated and the regime faces crippling economic pressure – pressure that will only build over time."
201211,61,61320,1052,NA,NA,President Obama believes that a diplomatic outcome remains the best and most enduring solution.
201211,61,61320,1053,NA,NA,"At the same time, he has also made clear that the window for diplomacy will not remain open indefinitely and that all options – including military force – remain on the table."
201211,61,61320,1054,NA,NA,"But we have an obligation to use the time and space that exists now to put increasing pressure on the Iranian regime to live up to its obligations and rejoin the community of nations, or face the consequences."
201211,61,61320,1055,NA,NA,"North Korea. President Obama will also continue to confront North Korea, another regime that ignores its international obligations by developing nuclear weapons and missile technology, with a stark choice: take verifiable steps toward denuclearization"
201211,61,61320,1056,NA,NA,or face increasing isolation and costs from the United States and the international community.
201211,61,61320,1057,NA,NA,That is why the administration worked with international partners to impose the harshest multilateral sanctions on North Korea in history.
201211,61,61320,1058,NA,NA,"And it is why the President has made clear that the transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States and our allies, and we would hold North Korea accountable for the consequences of such action."
201211,61,61320,1059,NA,NA,"Securing Loose Nuclear Materials. The President has led a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world,"
201211,61,61320,1060,NA,NA,"hosting a nuclear security summit in Washington,"
201211,61,61320,1061,NA,NA,and making concrete progress in locking these materials down.
201211,61,61320,1062,NA,NA,This is an important goal because the prospect that al-Qaeda or another terrorist organization might acquire a nuclear device represents an immediate and extreme threat to global security.
201211,61,61320,1063,NA,NA,"At the same time, the United States will continue to work with international partners to break up black markets,"
201211,61,61320,1064,NA,NA,"detect and intercept nuclear materials in transit,"
201211,61,61320,1065,NA,NA,and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade.
201211,61,61320,1066,NA,NA,"Russia. Crucial to achieving all of these objectives has been, and will remain, expanded cooperation with Russia."
201211,61,61320,1067,NA,NA,"The Cold War mentality represented by Mitt Romney’s identification of Russia as “our number one geopolitical foe” ignores the very real common interest we share with Russia in reducing nuclear stockpiles,"
201211,61,61320,1068,NA,NA,"stopping additional proliferation by countries such as Iran and North Korea,"
201211,61,61320,1069,NA,NA,and preventing nuclear materials from falling into the hands of terrorists.
201211,61,61320,1070,NA,NA,"The President’s “reset” policy toward Russia has produced significant cooperation in these areas, as well as in Russian support for the Northern Distribution Network that supplies our troops in Afghanistan."
201211,61,61320,1071,NA,NA,"We support establishing permanent, normal trade relations with Russia because it would be good for the U.S. economy, for U.S. businesses, and for U.S. workers if we do."
201211,61,61320,1072,NA,NA,And securing Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization is an important step toward encouraging Russia to follow a rules-based system

201211,61,61320,1074,NA,NA,"At the same time, we are candid with the Russians when we disagree."
201211,61,61320,1075,NA,NA,The administration will not put aside our differences but will raise them directly with the Russian government.
201211,61,61320,1076,NA,NA,"And we will continue to strongly criticize Russian actions that we oppose, such as their support for the Assad regime in Syria."
201211,61,61320,1078,NA,NA,"As we have taken decisive steps to address today’s dangers from terrorism and to prevent future nuclear proliferation,"
201211,61,61320,1079,NA,NA,"we have also sought to bolster homeland security and head off emerging challenges, ranging from cyber and biological threats to climate change and transnational crime."

201211,61,61320,1081,NA,NA,"The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower individual criminal hackers, organized criminal groups, terrorist networks, and other advanced nations to disrupt the critical infrastructure that is vital to our economy, commerce, public safety, and military."
201211,61,61320,1082,NA,NA,"Defending against cyber threats requires networks that are secure, trustworthy, and resilient."
201211,61,61320,1083,NA,NA,"The President and the administration have taken unprecedented steps to defend America from cyber attacks,"
201211,61,61320,1084,NA,NA,including creating the first military command dedicated to cybersecurity

201211,61,61320,1092,NA,NA,The use of a lethal biological agent within a population center would threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
201211,61,61320,1093,NA,NA,That’s why President Obama outlined a National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats in 2009 to address the challenges from proliferation of biological weapons or their use by terrorists.
201211,61,61320,1094,NA,NA,We will continue to work at home with first responders and health officials to reduce the risks associated with unintentional or deliberate outbreaks of infectious disease.

201211,61,61620,1443,NA,NA,"Finally, the strategy subordinates our national security interests to environmental, energy, and international health issues, and elevates “climate change” to the level of a “severe threat” equivalent to foreign aggression."
201211,61,61620,1444,NA,NA,"The word “climate,” in fact, appears in the current President’s strategy more often than Al Qaeda, nuclear proliferation, radical Islam, or weapons of mass destruction."

201211,61,61620,1450,NA,NA,"The President plans to reduce our naval forces by retiring seven cruisers and slowing work on amphibious ships and attack submarines, further reducing the Navy that already has the smallest fleet since the early years of the twentieth century."

201211,61,61620,1461,NA,NA,"In tandem with this, the current Administration has systematically undermined America’s missile defense, abandoning the missile defense bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, reducing the number of planned interceptors in Alaska, and cutting the budget for missile defense."
201211,61,61620,1462,NA,NA,"In an embarrassing open microphone discussion with former Russian President Medvedev, the current President made clear that, if he wins a second term, he intends to exercise “more flexibility” to appease Russia, which means further undermining our missile defense capabilities."
201211,61,61620,1463,NA,NA,A Republican President will be honest and forthright with the American people about his policies and plans and not whisper promises to authoritarian leaders.

201211,61,61620,1481,NA,NA,The current Administration’s laws and policies undermine what should be a collaborative relationship and put both the government and private entities at a severe disadvantage in proactively identifying potential cyberthreats.
201211,61,61620,1482,NA,NA,The costly and heavyhanded regulatory approach by the current Administration will increase the size and cost of the federal bureaucracy and harm innovation in cybersecurity.

201105,62,62420,350,NA,NA,"Elle stimulera le recrutement, au moment où les Forces ont de la difficulté à enrôler suffisamment de candidats dans plusieurs catégories professionnelles, notamment dans les secteurs hautement spécialisés ou techniques."
201105,62,62420,351,NA,NA,"Par ailleurs, l'aide aux études facilitera la réinsertion du personnel des Forces canadiennes au sein de la société et de la population active."
201105,62,62420,352,NA,NA,L'idée présente des avantages à la fois pour les personnes concernées et pour l'économie canadienne axée sur le savoir et les compétences.
201105,62,62420,353,1,1,"Si l'on se fie aux projections actuelles portant sur les taux d'attrition et les besoins des Forces, et si l'on suppose un haut taux de participation au programme, cela représente un investissement évalué à 120 millions de $ pour l'apprentissage des anciens combattants au cours des deux premières années d'un gouvernement libéral."
201105,62,62420,355,1,1,"Aux prises avec une population vieillissante et un taux de natalité décroissant, le Canada aura besoin de davantage d’immigrants pour maintenir sa croissance démographique et pour combler ses besoins en main d’oeuvre."
201105,62,62420,356,2,-1,"Malheureusement, les immigrants réussissent moins bien que les citoyens canadiens nés ici, un écart qui s’est accentué au cours des trente dernières années."
201105,62,62420,357,2,0,Les études nous ont démontré à maintes reprises que l’incapacité pour les immigrants de fonctionner dans l’une ou l’autre des langues officielles du pays est un obstacle majeur à leur succès au travail et dans leur communauté.
201105,62,62420,358,NA,NA,"De plus, les compétences linguistiques ont une influence positive sur les salaires des individus et sur la productivité au sein de notre économie."
201105,62,62420,359,2,1,Seulement environ 25 pour cent des gens qui arrivent au pays reçoivent une formation linguistique financée par le gouvernement fédéral.
201105,62,62420,360,NA,NA,"Malgré cela, le gouvernement Harper a réduit son engagement dans ce domaine crucial en ne déboursant pas les fonds alloués et même en sabrant dans les fonds prévus pour la formation linguistique de base."
201105,62,62420,361,NA,NA,Les règles font aussi partie du problème puisque les nouveaux arrivants n’ont plus accès à la formation linguistique dès le moment où ils deviennent citoyens canadiens.
201105,62,62420,362,NA,NA,Les libéraux croient qu'il est dans l'intérêt de tous que les nouveaux Canadiens réussissent dans le marché du travail et qu'ils participent pleinement au sein de leur communauté.
201105,62,62420,363,NA,NA,"À travers la stratégie canadienne d'apprentissage, un gouvernement libéral augmentera de manière significative les fonds alloués afin d'améliorer et d'élargir les programmes de formation linguistique, pour atteindre une majoration de 100 millions de $ annuellement dans un horizon de 4 ans."
201105,62,62420,364,NA,NA,Nous élargirons également les critères d'admissibilité afin d'inclure les citoyens qui ne sont pas nés au Canada et qui ont besoin d'améliorer leur niveau de langue anglaise et française.
201105,62,62420,365,NA,NA,Nous travaillerons avec nos partenaires pour rendre la formation linguistique plus accessible et mieux diffuser l'information auprès des participants potentiels afin d'en augmenter le nombre.
201105,62,62420,367,1,1,"Il est dans l'intérêt du Canada d'attirer les meilleurs étudiants étrangers, surtout ceux qui proviennent des puissances économiques émergentes, et de maintenir leurs liens avec le Canada une fois leurs études terminées."
201105,62,62420,368,1,1,Nous voulons aussi soutenir les initiatives qui permettent aux étudiants canadiens d'aller étudier et faire du bénévolat outre-mer.
201105,62,62420,369,NA,NA,"Dans le monde de plus en plus interdépendant dans lequel nous vivons, l'entreprenariat et l'innovation dans tous les domaines seront nourris par le flux d'idées auquel seront soumis d'une part les étudiants canadiens qui iront étudier à l'étranger et d'autre part les étudiants étrangers qui découvrent notre pays, notre culture, notre économie et notre système d'éducation postsecondaire."
201105,62,62420,370,NA,NA,"Nous tirerons davantage de notre réputation pour notre ouverture, notre multiculturalisme et notre excellence en éducation, en faisant de l'apprentissage une composante majeure d'une nouvelle initiative de « bran ding » du Canada."
201105,62,62420,372,NA,NA,"À un moment donné, presque chaque famille aura à relever le défi de la maladie d’un être cher, que ce soit un parent vieillissant, un jeune enfant, un époux ou un partenaire."
201105,62,62420,373,NA,NA,"Les familles canadiennes assument la responsabilité de prendre soin de leurs proches, et elles méritent un gouvernement qui les soutient."
201105,62,62420,374,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral améliorera le sort des familles en les aidant à assumer les dépenses reliées aux soins des êtres chers malades ou vieillissants.
201105,62,62420,375,NA,NA,"Pour le Canada, il est logique sur le plan économique d’appuyer les familles."
201105,62,62420,376,NA,NA,De nombreux aidants naturels sont obligés de choisi entre demeurer sur le marché du travail et prendre soin de leurs proches.
201105,62,62420,377,NA,NA,Le Canada doit tenir compte des répercussions qu’entraîne le vieillissement de la population sur sa productivité.
201105,62,62420,378,NA,NA,Faciliter la tâche des aidants naturels afin qu’ils puissent concilier le travail et les soins les aidera.
201105,62,62420,379,NA,NA,"Nous vivons à une époque difficile au niveau économique, ce qui veut dire que les gouvernements – et les Canadiens – doivent faire des choix."
201105,62,62420,380,NA,NA,Nous choisissons d’aider les familles canadiennes.
201105,62,62420,381,NA,NA,"Aujourd’hui, 2,7 millions de Canadiens prennent soin de personnes âgées."
201105,62,62420,382,NA,NA,"Les aidants naturels sont responsables de 80 pour cent des soins à domicile, dispensant chaque année plus de 9 milliards de $ en soins non rémunérés."
201105,62,62420,383,NA,NA,􀁦 Plus de 40 pour cent des aidants naturels ont recours à leurépargne personnelle pour joindre les deux bouts.
201105,62,62420,384,NA,NA,􀁦 Le quart des aidants naturels s’absentent du travail pendantau moins un mois pour fournir des soins.
201105,62,62420,385,NA,NA,􀁦 65 pour cent des aidants naturels disposent d’un revenu familial inférieur à 45 000$.
201105,62,62420,386,NA,NA,"􀁦 Les trois quarts des aidants naturels sont des femmes, plus susceptiblesd’avoir des salaires inférieurs, moins d’épargnes"
201105,62,62420,388,NA,NA,"Afin d'améliorer les soins offerts à nos êtres chers qui sont malades, sans égard à leur âge, et afin de reconnaître l'importante contribution des aidants naturels, un gouvernement libéral investira 1 milliard de $ annuellement dans un nouveau Plan pour les soins familiaux."
201105,62,62420,389,NA,NA,Ce plan permettra d'amenuiser les pressions économiques sur plusieurs centaines de milliers de familles canadiennes qui peinent à joindre les deux bouts.
201105,62,62420,391,NA,NA,1) Une nouvelle prestation d'assurance-emploi de six mois pour les soins familiaux afin de permettre à plus de Canadiens de prendre congé et de prendre soin de leurs êtres chers gravement malades sans avoir à quitter leur emploi;
201105,62,62420,392,NA,NA,"2) Une nouvelle prestation fiscale pour les soins familiaux, basée sur le modèle de la prestation fiscale pour enfants, afin de venir en aide aux aidants naturels à faible ou moyen revenu qui prodiguent des soins essentiels à un membre de la famille à domicile."
201105,62,62420,393,NA,NA,Une nouvelle prestation d'assurance-emploi de six mois pour les soins familiaux.
201105,62,62420,394,NA,NA,Le régime d'assurance-emploi prévoit des prestations de compassion aux Canadiens qui doivent s'absenter de leur travail afin de prendre soin et de venir en aide à un membre de leur famille atteint d'une maladie grave.
201105,62,62420,395,NA,NA,"En vertu du programme actuel, un aidant naturel ne peut recevoir des prestations d'assurance-emploi que pendant six semaines et, conformément aux règles d'admissibilité, doit abdiquer tout espoir en obtenant la confirmation d'un médecin que le membre de sa famille est «gravement malade et qu'il y a un risque élevé que l'être cher décède au cours des 26 prochaines semaines.»"
201105,62,62420,396,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral remplacera la prestation de compassion de six semaines par une nouvelle prestation d'assurance-emploi de six mois pour les soins familiaux.
201105,62,62420,397,NA,NA,"Le nouveau programme comporte des exigences d'admissibilité plus humaines, par exemple en modifiant la nature du billet médical requis."
201105,62,62420,398,NA,NA,Nous accroîtrons également la souplesse du programme en permettant que les six mois soient répartis en blocs sur une période d'un an et en autorisant les membres de la famille à partager les six mois pour prodiguer des soins.
201105,62,62420,399,NA,NA,La nouvelle prestation d'assurance-emploi pour les soins familiaux coûtera 250 millions de $ par année et elle appuiera quelques 30 000 aidants naturels.
201105,62,62420,400,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral ne majorera pas les cotisations d'assurance-emploi pour financer cette mesure.
201105,62,62420,402,NA,NA,Bien des aidants naturels ne versent actuellement pas de cotisations au régime d’assurance-emploi et ne sont donc pas admissibles à l’actuelle prestation de compassion.
201105,62,62420,403,NA,NA,"Ce groupe comprend des travailleurs autonomes, des retraités et des gens qui ont dû quitter leur emploi pour prendre soin d’un membre de leur famille qui est malade."
201105,62,62420,404,NA,NA,"De plus, le crédit d’impôt actuel pour les aidants naturels se limite aux personnes qui s’occupent d’un membre de leur famille vivant sous le même toit, et ne profite pas à de nombreux Canadiens qui n’ont pas un revenu suffisamment élevé."
201105,62,62420,405,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral mettra en place une nouvelle prestation fiscale pour les soins familiaux afin de soutenir les aidants naturels à faible ou moyen revenu, peu importe leur situation d'emploi."
201105,62,62420,406,NA,NA,"Pour aider les Canadiens à assumer le coût des soins prodigués à des membres de leur famille vivant à la maison, cette nouvelle prestation prendra la forme d'un versement mensuel non imposable d'une valeur maximale de 1 350 $ par année."
201105,62,62420,407,NA,NA,Cette nouvelle prestation sera appliquée de la même façon que la prestation fiscale canadienne pour enfants et elle sera offerte à tous les aidants naturels dont le revenu familial est inférieur à 106 000$ qui produiront un certificat médical confirmant qu'un membre malade de leur famille requiert d'importants soins et de l'aide pour exécuter les tâches courantes de la vie.
201105,62,62420,408,NA,NA,Les familles ayant des enfants malades qui rencontrent les critères seront également admissibles.
201105,62,62420,409,NA,NA,La nouvelle prestation fiscale pour les soins familiaux aidera près de 600 000 aidants naturels au coût de 750 millions de $ par année.
201105,62,62420,411,NA,NA,Les Canadiens qui travaillent toute leur vie afin de subvenir aux besoins de leur famille méritent une retraite sûre et confortable.
201105,62,62420,412,NA,NA,"Malheureusement, de moins en moins de Canadiens ont accès à un régime de retraite de qualité parrainé par leur employeur."
201105,62,62420,413,NA,NA,"De fait, en 2008, 75 pour cent de tous les employés du secteur privé n’avaient pas de régime enregistré de retraite."
201105,62,62420,414,NA,NA,"Entre-temps, le niveau de cotisations à un régime enregistré d’épargne-retraite (REER) n’a pas augmenté au cours de la dernière décennie et seulement un contribuable sur quatre verse une cotisation à un REER."
201105,62,62420,415,NA,NA,"Pis encore, bien des REER exigent des frais annuels de 2 % ou plus sur l’actif."
201105,62,62420,416,NA,NA,"Les coûts, les risques et la complexité des REER découragent plusieurs Canadiens d’utiliser cette méthode d’épargne pour la retraite."
201105,62,62420,417,NA,NA,"Grâce au travail du gouvernement libéral dans les années 1990, les assises du Régime de pensions du Canada (RPC) et du programme de Sécurité de la vieillesse (SV) sont solides."
201105,62,62420,418,NA,NA,"Cependant, pour bien des aînés, ces deux pièces maîtresses de notre régime de retraite constituent la seule source de revenus."
201105,62,62420,419,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement Harper a refusé de bonifier le RPC, même s’il a laissé flotter l’idée plusieurs mois."
201105,62,62420,420,NA,NA,Il a plutôt opté pour une option du secteur privé qui ne ferait presque rien de plus que les REER.
201105,62,62420,421,NA,NA,"Même si le secteur financier a un rôle important à jouer pour les investisseurs qui peuvent se permettre les frais et assumer les risques, une option du secteur privé à elle seule ne sera pas adéquate."
201105,62,62420,422,NA,NA,"L’approche de M. Harper est certes bien vue sur Bay Street, mais ne satisfait pas aux besoins des familles canadiennes."
201105,62,62420,423,NA,NA,"Un régime de retraite solide doit être offert à tous les Canadiens, plutôt qu’être un luxe réservé à quelques privilégiés."
201105,62,62420,424,NA,NA,La manière la plus fiable et abordable d’y arriver est de renforcer le Régime de pensions du Canada qui a si bien servi les Canadiens.
201105,62,62420,425,NA,NA,"Le RPC offre d’énormes avantages aux employeurs et aux employés en évitant les risques, la complexité et les frais administratifs qui trop souvent drainent les épargnes de retraite gérées par le secteur privé."
201105,62,62420,426,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral travaillera avec les provinces et les territoires pour bonifier le Régime de pensions du Canada de deux façons complémentaires.
201105,62,62420,427,NA,NA,Nous appuierons une augmentation graduelle des prestations déterminées par le RPC de base afin d'améliorer la sécurité de retraite de tous les Canadiens.
201105,62,62420,428,NA,NA,"De plus, un gouvernement libéral proposera un nouveau supplément volontaire au RPC, l'option de retraite sûre (ORS)."
201105,62,62420,429,NA,NA,L'ORS sera offerte à tout travailleur canadien qui le souhaite et sera aussi souple que possible.
201105,62,62420,430,NA,NA,L'adhésion à l'ORS sera complètement volontaire et les Canadiens pourraient économiser entre 5 à 100/0 de plus de leur salaire dans un fonds de retraite sûr et appuyé par le RPC.
201105,62,62420,431,NA,NA,"Ce serait une option pour les millions de Canadiens qui ne peuvent se permettre ni les risques, ni les coûts des marchés boursiers ou des REER."
201105,62,62420,433,NA,NA,o Une augmentation graduelle du Régime de pensions du Canada
201105,62,62420,434,NA,NA,"o L’option de retraite sûre, un supplément volontaire au Régime de pensions du Canada"
201105,62,62420,435,NA,NA,o Protection des prestations d’invalidité de longue durée en cas de faillite
201105,62,62420,436,NA,NA,o Une agence protégeant les pensions de retraite d’entreprises en faillite
201105,62,62420,437,NA,NA,"Les cotisations au compte ORS seraient assujetties aux mêmes limites que les contributions au REER, afin d'éviter que les mieux nantis puissent se soustraire à l'impôt de façon inéquitable."
201105,62,62420,438,NA,NA,"Les employeurs auraient aussi la possibilité de contribuer au compte ORS de leurs employés, ce qui constituerait un avantage notamment pour les petites et moyennes entreprises pour lesquelles il serait autrement trop onéreux de mettre sur pied un régime de retraite."
201105,62,62420,439,NA,NA,"Grâce à l'effet de levier du RPC, les employeurs de toutes les tailles auraient accès à un important fonds commun dont les frais administratifs et les risques seraient bas."
201105,62,62420,440,NA,NA,"L'ORS serait aussi entièrement transférable, ce qui permettrait aux travailleurs de continuer à y verser des cotisations même s'ils changent d'un employeur à l'autre."
201105,62,62420,441,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral mettra en oeuvre cette approche novatrice pour la sécurité de retraite en travaillant de concert avec les gouvernements provinciaux et territoriaux.
201105,62,62420,442,NA,NA,Il est en effet nécessaire d'obtenir l'engagement de ces derniers pour changer le RPC et le Régime de rentes du Québec.
201105,62,62420,443,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral prendra des mesures supplémentaires pour veiller à ce que le Régime de pensions du Canada protège les personnes les plus vulnérables de notre société.
201105,62,62420,444,NA,NA,Nous ferons en sorte que les bénéficiaires de prestations d'invalidité de longue durée puissent bénéficier d'une protection étendue au cas où l'entreprise offrant le régime ferait faillite.
201105,62,62420,445,NA,NA,Nous créerons aussi une agence protégeant les pensions de retraite d'entreprises en faillite.
201105,62,62420,446,NA,NA,Cette agence offrira aux employés dont l'entreprise a fait faillite l'option de transférer leurs pensions au RPC afin de faire fructifier leurs actifs de retraite avec un régime qui est sûr au lieu de les laisser dans un fonds à faible rendement.
201105,62,62420,448,NA,NA,"Cette nouvelle option publique, dans le cadre du RPC, changera la donne pour ceux et celles qui n’ont pas de plan de pension."
201105,62,62420,449,NA,NA,"Elle leur permettrait d’éviter les risques, la complexité et les frais administratifs cachés qui caractérisent les REER."
201105,62,62420,450,NA,NA,"Par exemple, un ménage de deux personnes avec un revenu combiné qui commence à 35 000$ par année et qui augmente jusqu’à 65 000$ au fil du temps aura besoin d’une pension annuelle de 14 000$ en plus du RPC et de la SV pour obtenir une pension équivalant à 60 pour cent de leur revenu à l’âge de la retraite."
201105,62,62420,451,NA,NA,Un taux de contribution de 6 pour cent de la paie brute à un compte ORS permettrait à ce ménage d’atteindre ce but.
201105,62,62420,452,NA,NA,Les travailleurs participants qui cotisent davantage ou qui travaillent pour un employeur qui en fait de même bénéficieraient d’une retraite encore plus généreuse.
201105,62,62420,454,NA,NA,La pension de la sécurité de la vieillesse et le supplément de revenu garanti (SRG) fournissent aux aînés à faible revenu une prestation pleinement indexée qui garantit un niveau minimal de revenu tout au long des années de retraite.
201105,62,62420,455,NA,NA,"Toutefois, un nombre croissant d'entre eux sont aux prises avec la pauvreté."
201105,62,62420,456,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral, et en fait la plupart des Canadiens, ne peuvent accepter cette situation sans que rien ne soit fait pour y remédier."
201105,62,62420,457,NA,NA,"Dans leur budget électoral qui a été rejeté, les conservateurs de Harper ont pris une mesure modeste et décevante, mais un gouvernement libéral ira bien plus loin."
201105,62,62420,458,NA,NA,"Nous bonifierons la prestation SRG de 700 millions de $ par an pour les aînés à faible revenu, renforçant ainsi un outil important en vue d'éliminer la pauvreté chez les aînés, surtout chez les femmes âgées et les aînés handicapés."
201105,62,62420,460,NA,NA,L’élection en cours pose une question simple : à qui faites-vous confiance pour parler au nom du Canada au moment où des décisions cruciales se prennent sur l’avenir de notre système de soins de santé?
201105,62,62420,461,NA,NA,Ce sont les gouvernements libéraux qui ont mis en place l’assurance-maladie universelle et qui ont voté la Loi canadienne sur la santé.
201105,62,62420,462,NA,NA,Un nouveau gouvernement libéral offrira un engagement robuste et renouvelé.
201105,62,62420,463,NA,NA,"Pour les libéraux, comme pour la plupart des Canadiens, l’accès universel à des soins de qualité au moment opportun, sans égard ni à la capacité de payer, ni à la province de résidence, fait partie de ce qui définit le Canada."
201105,62,62420,464,NA,NA,Cette prémisse se trouve au coeur des valeurs canadiennes et des réalisations libérales.
201105,62,62420,465,NA,NA,"Sous un leadership libéral, le gouvernement redeviendra un partenaire sérieux dans la santé et les soins de santé."
201105,62,62420,466,NA,NA,Les Canadiens se préoccupent de plus en plus de la viabilité du système et de la qualité des services que nous obtenons pour l’argent qui y est investi.
201105,62,62420,467,NA,NA,Les difficultés économiques poussent certains à offrir de fausses solutions.
201105,62,62420,468,NA,NA,"Un ticket modérateur, par exemple, pourrait faire en sorte que les soins de santé soient plus dispendieux pour tous les Canadiens."
201105,62,62420,470,NA,NA,à obtenir des soins quand elles en ont besoin pourraient voir leur état s’aggraver et devoir nécessiter des interventions encore plus coûteuses ultérieurement.
201105,62,62420,471,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement fédéral joue un important rôle dans les soins de santé sur le plan du financement, de la recherche et de l’information, de la promotion de la santé publique, de la réglementation des médicaments, de la poursuite d’objectifs et de principes pancanadiens,"
201105,62,62420,472,NA,NA,ainsi que de la livraison des services pour les Autochtones
201105,62,62420,473,NA,NA,et les anciens combattants.
201105,62,62420,474,NA,NA,Le gouvernement fédéral est aussi en mesure de travailler avec les provinces pour promouvoir l’innovation et rendre disponibles les meilleures pratiques élaborées au Canada et à l’étranger.
201105,62,62420,475,NA,NA,Ce qui importe le plus est la façon dont un gouvernement libéral voudra bâtir sur le bilan de ses réalisations antérieures.
201105,62,62420,478,NA,NA,celles qui doivent prendre soin d’un être cher à domicile;
201105,62,62420,479,NA,NA,2) réaliser des améliorations mesurables et à long terme en ce qui a trait aux résultats en matière de santé;

201105,62,62420,481,NA,NA,4) maîtriser les coûts à long terme.
201105,62,62420,482,NA,NA,Parler au nom du Canada se révèle être d'une grande importance dans l'atteinte de ces objectifs car aucun gouvernement ne peut à lui seul être aussi efficace que s'il collabore véritablement avec les autres gouvernements et avec les parties intéressées.

201105,62,62420,494,NA,NA,Un grand nombre de moyens pour améliorer la qualité de vie de tous les Canadiens se trouvent dans des solutions qui n’ont rien à voir avec les hôpitaux ou les cabinets de médecin.
201105,62,62420,495,NA,NA,Il en résulterait des économies de plusieurs milliards de dollars en coûts liés aux soins de santé.

201105,62,62420,650,NA,NA,"Pour nous aider à atteindre cet objectif, nous ressusciterons le programme Encouragement à la production d'énergie renouvelable (EPER), un programme très efficace qui a été supprimé par les conservateurs de Harper."
201105,62,62420,651,NA,NA,"Ce programme incitera les producteurs d'énergie renouvelable à accélérer le développement de technologies commercialisables axées sur des sources telles que le soleil, le vent, les marées et la biomasse."
201105,62,62420,652,NA,NA,"Parallèlement aux initiatives provinciales et à un plan canadien sur la lutte contre les changements climatiques dont il est question plus loin dans ce chapitre, un investissement d'un milliard de $ dans le programme EPER augmentera les sources d'énergie renouvelable du Canada à 10 pour cent de notre production énergétique globale d'ici 2017."
201105,62,62420,653,NA,NA,L'énergie renouvelable doit occuper une place grand issante au sein des sources d'approvisionnement d'énergie du Canada.
201105,62,62420,654,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral travaillera à réaliser cet objectif.
201105,62,62420,655,NA,NA,Le Canada doit agir sur tous les fronts - produire plus d'énergie renouvelable
201105,62,62420,656,NA,NA,et réduire l'empreinte écologique et les émissions de carbone liées à l'exploitation et à la consommation d'énergie fossile.
201105,62,62420,658,NA,NA,L'exploitation des sables bitumineux doit devenir plus durable étant donné que cette ressource majeure continuera de contribuer à la prospérité du Canada.
201105,62,62420,659,NA,NA,"Dans le cadre du partenariat canadien pour l'énergie propre, un gouvernement libéral travaillera à:"
201105,62,62420,660,NA,NA,"~ accélérer le développement et le déploiement de technologies qui réduiront tous les impacts environnementaux, y compris l'empreinte carbone, de l'exploitation des sables bitumineux avec pour objectif d'éliminer l'écart de 15 pour cent qui existe avec les hydrocarbures traditionnels;"
201105,62,62420,661,NA,NA,~ augmenter la rigueur avec laquelle le gouvernement fédéral s'acquitte de ses responsabilités liées à la règlementation de l'exploitation des sables bitumineux; et
201105,62,62420,662,NA,NA,~ améliorer la base de connaissances sur laquelle doit s'appuyer une règlementation responsable en investissant davantage dans la recherche scientifique et la surveillance relatives à l'exploitation des sables bitumineux.
201105,62,62420,663,NA,NA,"L’objectif fondamental de ces mesures, bien sûr, est d’exploiter les sables bitumineux de façon moins polluante et « plus ordonnée », comme le préconise l’ancien Premier ministre de l’Alberta, Peter Lougheed."
201105,62,62420,664,NA,NA,L’industrie des sables bitumineux tente d’améliorer l’image qu’on a d’elle aux États-Unis et dans le monde.
201105,62,62420,665,NA,NA,Ceci est aussi problématique pour le Canada.
201105,62,62420,666,NA,NA,La meilleure façon d’améliorer cette image est d’accélérer la réduction de l’impact environnemental de l’exploitation des sables bitumineux.
201105,62,62420,667,NA,NA,"Tout progrès réalisé dans ce dossier aidera le Canada à lutter contre les changements climatiques et à bien gérer notre eau, notre terre et notre faune."
201105,62,62420,668,NA,NA,"Pour encourager une exploitation moins polluante des sables bitumineux, un gouvernement libéral mettra immédiatement fin à l'allègement fiscal important qui profite à l'industrie."
201105,62,62420,669,NA,NA,Le gouvernement Harper élimine progressivement d'ici 2015 la déduction pour amortissement accéléré pour les investissements dans les sables bitumineux.
201105,62,62420,670,NA,NA,Des mesures plus décisives produiront des revenus d'État de près de 500 millions de $ au cours des deux prochaines années.
201105,62,62420,671,NA,NA,Nous réserverons ces fonds pour deux objectifs.
201105,62,62420,672,NA,NA,Nous investirons dans: des nouvelles mesures incitatives pour encourager les investissements ciblant les technologies émergentes qui réduisent les émissions de gaz à effet de serre et les autres impacts environnementaux de l'exploitation des sables bitumineux.
201105,62,62420,673,NA,NA,Nous investirons aussi dans la recherche scientifique et la surveillance des impacts environnementaux de l'exploitation des sables bitumineux afin d'acquérir les connaissances qui permettront de mieux informer l'acquittement des responsabilités fédérales en matière de règlementation.
201105,62,62420,674,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement Harper s’est engagé à « éliminer progressivement et à rationaliser » les subventions à l’exploitation des hydrocarbures, tout comme les autres membres du G20 réunis au sommet des chefs qui s’est déroulé à Pittsburgh en 2009."
201105,62,62420,675,NA,NA,"Cependant, aucune mesure n’a été prise au Canada et l’initiative n’a même pas été mentionnée dans le communiqué final diffusé lors du sommet du G20 suivant, qui a eu lieu en juin 2010 sous la présidence de Stephen Harper."
201105,62,62420,676,NA,NA,"Dans son approche équilibrée à l’exploitation des sables bitumineux, un gouvernement libéral prendra au sérieux cette obligation internationale."
201105,62,62420,678,NA,NA,"Les conservateurs de Stephen Harper ont promis de fixer le prix du carbone lors de la dernière élection fédérale, mais ils n’ont pas tenu cette promesse."
201105,62,62420,679,NA,NA,"Après cinq ans et quatre ministres de l’Environnement, ils ne se sont toujours pas penchés sur la question des émissions de gaz du Canada et n’ont pas bâti l’économie éconergétique de demain."
201105,62,62420,680,NA,NA,L’industrie canadienne cherche la clarté et appuie de façon générale une approche de réduction des émissions axée sur le marché.
201105,62,62420,681,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral mettra sur pied un système de plafonnement et d'échanges - un mécanisme qui établira un plafond des émissions totales de gaz à effet de serre provenant des grandes installations industrielles et qui vendra aux enchères des permis d'émission aux entreprises qui pourront ensuite s'échanger ces permis entre elles en conformité avec la loi.
201105,62,62420,682,NA,NA,L’Europe a déjà adopté un système de plafonnement et d’échanges.
201105,62,62420,683,NA,NA,"Au Canada, face à l’inertie du gouvernement Harper, la Colombie-Britannique, le Manitoba, l’Ontario et le Québec se sont joints à des états américains pour mettre en place d’ici 2015 un système de plafonnement et d’échanges dans le cadre de la Western Climate Initiative (WCI)."
201105,62,62420,684,NA,NA,"De concert avec les provinces, un gouvernement libéral mettra sur pied un système qui s'appliquera à tous les secteurs de l'économie, sans exception, et qui sera équitable pour toutes les régions du pays."
201105,62,62420,685,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral collaborera aussi de façon responsable avec d'autres pays et des organismes multilatéraux afin d'assurer l'adoption d'une entente internationale sur les changements climatiques qui soit musclée et fondée sur la science.
201105,62,62420,686,NA,NA,Les libéraux se sont engagés à une cible de réduction à long terme des émissions de 80 pour cent d’ici 2050 par rapport à leur niveau de 1990.
201105,62,62420,687,NA,NA,Nous avons aussi pressé le gouvernement Harper d’appuyer une entente internationale ambitieuse qui maintiendrait la hausse globale des températures sous la barre de 2oC.
201105,62,62420,688,NA,NA,"Par son obstruction gênante à la conférence de Copenhague et son invisibilité un an plus tard à Cancun, le gouvernement conservateur a démontré qu’il n’a nullement l’intention d’aider à conclure une nouvelle entente internationale."
201105,62,62420,689,NA,NA,Nous continuerons à progresser vers notre cible de réduction à long terme des émissions
201105,62,62420,690,NA,NA,"et nous demanderons à un organisme consultatif indépendant, la Table ronde nationale sur l'environnement et l'économie, de recommander des cibles à moyen terme réalisables qui seront basées sur des études scientifiques."
201105,62,62420,691,NA,NA,"Au lieu d'attendre le signal du Congrès américain pour agir, comme l'a fait le gouvernement Harper, un gouvernement libéral engagerait des pourparlers avec des interlocuteurs au sein de l'administration américaine et du Congrès sur des questions clés telles que le prix du carbone, la recherche et le développement liés aux normes et aux règlements, les technologies axées sur l'énergie propre, le développement coopératif du réseau électrique et les transports."
201105,62,62420,692,NA,NA,"Plutôt que de faire comme le gouvernement Harper et laisser la politique énergétique et environnementale canadienne entre les mains du Congrès, un gouvernement libéral agira dans l'intérêt des Canadiens."
201105,62,62420,695,NA,NA,"En dépit de notre relation profonde avec la nature, le Canada tire de l’arrière à l’échelle internationale en ce qui concerne la protection écologique."
201105,62,62420,696,NA,NA,Le Canada se classe au 16e rang des pays de l’OCDE pour la superficie de nos aires protégées.
201105,62,62420,697,NA,NA,"En fait, moins de 10 pour cent de nos terres et bien moins qu’un pour cent de nos territoires marins font l’objet de mesures de protection."
201105,62,62420,698,NA,NA,Le Canada ne déploie pas suffisamment d’efforts pour protéger sa biodiversité et pour assurer la préservation de ses écosystèmes fragiles pour des générations à venir.
201105,62,62420,699,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral s'alliera aux provinces, aux territoires, aux Premières nations et aux groupes voués à la conservation pour protéger davantage d'aires naturelles intactes du Canada."
201105,62,62420,700,NA,NA,"Il privilégiera une approche de conservation axée sur les écosystèmes en vertu de laquelle les parcs nationaux, les parcs provinciaux et les autres aires protégées, dont des parties de notre forêt boréale, seront reliés au moyen « d'écocorridors» protégés qui permettront aux espèces de se déplacer entre ces aires protégées."
201105,62,62420,702,NA,NA,"Le Canada a sur son territoire six des dix plus grands plans d’eau douce au monde et sept pour cent des réserves d’eau douce renouvelables de la planète, un trésor national que nous devons conserver."
201105,62,62420,703,NA,NA,"Nous ne pouvons pas tenir nos ressources en eau pour acquises, d’autant que la pollution, la surexploitation, les changements climatiques et la croissance de la population dans certaines régions mettent à risque la qualité et la disponibilité de l’eau."
201105,62,62420,704,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral travaillera avec les provinces, les municipalités et les parties intéressées pour élaborer une nouvelle stratégie canadienne sur l'eau douce, la première politique fédérale d'ensemble dans ce domaine en plus de vingt ans."
201105,62,62420,705,NA,NA,"Elle s'attaquera aux défis grandissants que sont la contamination des eaux souterraines, le besoin de nouvelles mesures pour combattre la sècheresse et les inondations, ainsi que l'utilisation plus efficace de l'eau."
201105,62,62420,706,NA,NA,Le but ultime de cette stratégie sera de conserver les réserves d'eau douce du Canada pour les générations à venir.
201105,62,62420,707,NA,NA,Cela comprendra la protection de nos ressources en eau contre l'exportation en vrac.
201105,62,62420,708,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral appuiera aussi les efforts d'assainissement des importants bassins hydrographiques en injectant 100 millions de $ par année qui augmentera jusqu'à 125 millions de $ dans:
201105,62,62420,710,NA,NA,~ les efforts d'assainissement du Lac Winnipeg qui contient des niveaux trop élevés de phosphore et d'azote; et;
201105,62,62420,711,NA,NA,~ les études et les efforts qui ont pour but de protéger les écosystèmes d'eau douce contre les espèces envahissantes telles que la moule zébrée.
201105,62,62420,713,NA,NA,Le littoral canadien est le plus long au monde.
201105,62,62420,714,NA,NA,"Nos eaux des océans Pacifique, Atlantique et Arctique abritent certains des écosystèmes marins les plus riches de la planète."
201105,62,62420,715,NA,NA,L’industrie de la pêche continuera d’être un élément clé du secteur des ressources naturelles du Canada. Toutefois
201105,62,62420,716,NA,NA,", la reconstitution des stocks et la volatilité des marchés constituent un double défi qui a amplifié les pressions financières sur les collectivités côtières."
201105,62,62420,717,NA,NA,L’engagement envers la gestion durable et responsable des stocks demeure fort au sein de l’industrie et un gouvernement libéral agira en tant que partenaire.
201105,62,62420,718,NA,NA,"Nous travaillerons de concert avec l'industrie pour aborder une vaste gamme de mesures, dont la rationalisation de la flotte et la création de programmes de retrait de permis de pêche dans les secteurs en crise, d'incitation à la retraite des travailleurs âgés et de rééducation professionnelle des travailleurs."
201105,62,62420,719,NA,NA,La capacité de pêche doit mieux refléter les ressources disponibles et certains travailleurs ont besoin d'une aide plus efficace pour effectuer la transition vers de nouvelles occasions d'emploi.
201105,62,62420,720,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral reconnaîtra également l'importance fondamentale du saumon du Pacific dans l'économie, les cultures et le mode de vie de la côte Ouest du Canada et s'assurera que sa conservation soit la priorité dans les questions portant sur les pêches dans ce coin du pays."
201105,62,62420,721,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral élargira le réseau de zones marines protégées du Canada et veillera à ce qu'il soit assorti d'une approche de gestion des océans plus efficace.
201105,62,62420,722,NA,NA,"En consultation avec les communautés côtières, les Premières nations, les gouvernements provinciaux, les entreprises touristiques, les industries océaniques et les autres intervenants, nous conviendrons des meilleures façons de réduire les facteurs de risque qui menacent la santé des océans."
201105,62,62420,723,NA,NA,"Afin de conserver nos territoires marins et de soutenir notre économie océanique, nous ferons avancer le dossier de la mise en oeuvre intégrée de la gestion et du zonage des océans avec la même rigueur qui s'applique à l'aménagement du territoire canadien."
201105,62,62420,724,NA,NA,"En attribuant des utilisations spécifiques aux zones marines, nous diminuerons le risque de conflit entre utilisateurs et nous atténuerons l'incidence cumulative des activités humaines tout en dotant l'industrie d'un cadre règlementaire mieux défini."
201105,62,62420,725,NA,NA,"La promotion d'une approche intégrée face au zonage des océans sera une pierre angulaire de la gestion durable des océans qui, en bout de ligne, permettra à l'industrie canadienne des pêches d'accéder au marché grandissant des fruits de mer éco-certifiés."
201105,62,62420,727,NA,NA,Le gouvernement Harper n’a pas pu assurer aux Canadiens que les capacités d’intervention du gouvernement fédéral suffiraient à la tâche si un désastre comparable à celui entraîné par l’explosion d’une plateforme pétrolière dans le golfe du Mexique devait se produire en eaux canadiennes.
201105,62,62420,728,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral procédera avec ses homologues provinciaux et territoriaux à une étude indépendante des capacités du Canada en matière d'intervention et de prévention des déversements pétroliers en haute mer, notamment en ce qui a trait aux cadres législatifs et règlementaires ainsi qu'aux capacités et aux pratiques actuellement en place."
201105,62,62420,729,NA,NA,"Une fois l'étude complétée, un gouvernement libéral élaborera un plan d'urgence de calibre mondial en cas de déversement pétrolier afin de veiller à ce que les meilleures mesures d'urgence et de sécurité soient intégrées aux coûts de fonctionnement des pétrolières."
201105,62,62420,730,NA,NA,"Dans l'éventualité d'un déversement pétrolier, les seuils absolus de responsabilité des entreprises sont actuellement de 30 ou 40 millions de $ selon l'organisme de réglementation qui régit leur exploitation."
201105,62,62420,731,NA,NA,Seules les entreprises reconnues coupables de négligence par un tribunal ont à payer plus.
201105,62,62420,732,NA,NA,"Étant donné les milliards de dollars que coûtera le nettoyage du golfe du Mexique, un gouvernement libéral établira de nouveaux seuils de responsabilité pour que les contribuables n'aient pas à défrayer la note en cas de déversements importants."
201105,62,62420,733,NA,NA,"En cas de déversements majeurs, les pêcheurs, les entreprises touristiques, les communautés côtières et les autres intervenants doivent être compensés adéquatement, sans avoir à recourir pendant des années aux tribunaux."
201105,62,62420,734,NA,NA,"Les nouveaux seuils de responsabilité tiendront compte des indemnités à verser en cas de perte de revenus ainsi que le coût des activités de nettoyage, sans pour autant être à ce point prohibitifs qu’ils entravent le fonctionnement des entreprises d’exploitation pétrolière et gazière."
201105,62,62420,736,NA,NA,Aucune technologie existante ne permettrait de nettoyer un déversement de pétrole sous les glaces de l’Arctique.
201105,62,62420,737,NA,NA,"Il y a deux ans, le gouvernement Harper a accéléré l’octroi de permis d’exploration à BP et Imperial Oil dans la mer de Beaufort, et ce, en sachant qu’il était impossible de protéger cette zone écologiquement sensible advenant un déversement majeur."
201105,62,62420,738,NA,NA,"Compte tenu de l'incertitude entourant la technologie, un gouvernement libéral mettra fin à l'octroi de nouveaux permis d'exploration pétrolière dans les eaux arctiques du Canada en attendant qu'une étude indépendante soit menée sur les risques qui y sont associés."
201105,62,62420,739,NA,NA,Une plus grande collaboration entre un réseau de gouvernements et de peuples autochtones est la clé de la stratégie libérale dans l'Arctique et de la politique étrangère libérale.
201105,62,62420,740,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral mènera des initiatives de coopération à l'échelle internationale sur les enjeux dans l'Arctique tels que les changements climatiques, la gestion des ressources naturelles, le développement responsable des ressources et les futures voies de transport commercial dans le passage du Nord-Ouest."
201105,62,62420,741,NA,NA,"Nous créerons et consoliderons des institutions multilatérales pour favoriser la coopération en matière de gestion des ressources naturelles, de développement économique et social, de transport, de recherche et sauvetage ainsi que de sécurité."
201105,62,62420,742,NA,NA,"Les priorités comprendraient un projet de cartographie conjointe des territoires et des plans d'eau de l'Arctique qui aidera à identifier les territoires, les pêches, la faune et les sites sacrés des peuples autochtones protégés par la communauté internationale."
201105,62,62420,744,NA,NA,"En 1972, le gouvernement libéral a imposé un moratoire sur le passage de pétroliers transportant du brut dans les eaux côtières du nord de la Colombie-Britannique."
201105,62,62420,745,NA,NA,"Ouvrir toute la côte de la Colombie-Britannique au passage de pétroliers transportant du brut augmenterait le risque d'un déversement majeur, mettant en danger la faune, la flore et la subsistance des douzaines de communautés qui vivent à proximité de l'océan."
201105,62,62420,746,NA,NA,"Pour prévenir un déversement dans l'écosystème fragile des eaux de la côte nord du Pacifique, un gouvernement libéral officialisera, soit en légiférant, en réglementant ou une combinaison des deux, le moratoire sur le passage de pétroliers transportant du brut dans ces eaux, y compris dans l'entrée Dixon, le détroit d'Hécate et celui de la Reine-Charlotte."
201105,62,62420,749,NA,NA,Un premier ministre responsable doit être imputable face aux Canadiens pour l’ensemble des décisions de son gouvernement.
201105,62,62420,750,NA,NA,"Mais, les libéraux croient que la responsabilité du Premier ministre est d’abord et avant tout de rassembler les Canadiens."
201105,62,62420,751,NA,NA,Les gouvernements libéraux ont toujours mis l’accent sur ce que les Canadiens ont en commun et sur ce que nous pouvons accomplir en tant que pays.
201105,62,62420,752,NA,NA,C’est ce genre de leadership dont nous avons de nouveau besoin.
201105,62,62420,753,NA,NA,"Plus que jamais, nous devons travailler à combler les écarts qui nous séparent et favoriser la contribution de chacun à renforcer nos communautés et faire du Canada un meilleur pays."
201105,62,62420,754,NA,NA,Le Canada n’est pas un pays égoïste qui manque d’ambition.
201105,62,62420,755,NA,NA,"Nous sommes un pays bilingue, une société multiculturelle et novatrice, fier de notre héritage, de nos communautés, de nos provinces, de nos villes et de notre diversité culturelle."
201105,62,62420,756,NA,NA,Notre diversité nous rend plus forts.
201105,62,62420,757,NA,NA,Nous attendons de nos dirigeants qu’ils reflètent le meilleur de nous-mêmes et qu’ils s’en inspirent.
201105,62,62420,758,NA,NA,"Les Canadiens attachent beaucoup d’importance à l’égalité – l’égalité entre les citoyens, entre les hommes et les femmes, entre les Autochtones et les non-Autochtones, entre le Nord et le Sud, entre les régions rurales et urbaines et entre les personnes ayant un handicap et leurs concitoyens."
201105,62,62420,759,NA,NA,L’égalité est le fondement de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés.
201105,62,62420,760,NA,NA,"En présence d’un écart entre l’idéal et la pratique, nous travaillons"
201105,62,62420,762,NA,NA,Nous sommes tous dans le même bateau.
201105,62,62420,763,NA,NA,Nos institutions démocratiques nous ont bien servis et nous nous attendons à ce que nos représentants les traitent avec respect.
201105,62,62420,764,NA,NA,Le fédéralisme canadien a évolué en fonction de nouvelles réalités et nous a permis de concilier nos identités multiples autour d’objectifs communs.
201105,62,62420,765,NA,NA,"Tout en préservant ce qu’il y a de meilleur dans nos institutions, nous devons aussi faire preuve d’ouverture face aux changements qui nous permettront de mieux nous adapter aux réalités d’un monde en rapide évolution."
201105,62,62420,767,NA,NA,"Les Canadiens sont fiers de leurs communautés qu’ils habitent la grande ville, une banlieue en expansion, une petite ville ou un village de campagne."
201105,62,62420,768,NA,NA,"Cependant, nous faisons face à de véritables défis."
201105,62,62420,769,NA,NA,"Malgré un recul de la criminalité, certaines familles ne se sentent pas en sécurité dans leurs propres quartiers."
201105,62,62420,770,NA,NA,"Plusieurs de nos concitoyens souffrent de maladies mentales qui ne sont pas soignées de manière adéquate, vivent dans la pauvreté, sont sans-abri, n’ont pas assez d’argent pour payer leur loyer ou n’ont d’autres choix que de louer des logements insalubres qui affectent la santé et le bien-être de leurs enfants."
201105,62,62420,771,NA,NA,Un trop grand nombre de Canadiens ayant un handicap ne jouissent pas du même niveau de vie que leurs concitoyens.
201105,62,62420,772,NA,NA,"Ces défis nous affectent tous, même si nous sommes fortunés de ne pas tous les vivre personnellement."
201105,62,62420,773,NA,NA,Ce sont des défis importants pour nos communautés.
201105,62,62420,774,NA,NA,Il y a des acquis sur lesquels nous pouvons construire.
201105,62,62420,775,NA,NA,"Des gens dédiés au service de nos communautés – les policiers, les pompiers et le personnel affecté aux services d’urgence - veillent sans relâche à notre sécurité."
201105,62,62420,776,NA,NA,Nous devons leur fournir les outils dont ils ont besoin pour mener leurs tâches à bien.
201105,62,62420,777,NA,NA,"Les groupes communautaires ainsi que les gouvernements provinciaux, territoriaux et locaux formulent des stratégies pour contrer la pauvreté et s’attaquer à des problèmes précis tels que le manque de logements abordables."
201105,62,62420,778,NA,NA,Ils ont besoin que le gouvernement fédéral soit un meilleur partenaire.
201105,62,62420,780,NA,NA,Canadiens font preuve de générosité en faisant du bénévolat et nous pouvons continuer de renforcer nos communautés avec davantage de bénévolat.
201105,62,62420,781,NA,NA,L’unique préoccupation du gouvernement Harper au sujet de nos communautés a été de punir le crime et d’exploiter la peur.
201105,62,62420,782,NA,NA,Le Directeur parlementaire du budget estime qu’à lui seul l’un de leurs projets de loi sur la criminalité coûtera entre 10 et 13 milliards de $ au gouvernement fédéral et aux provinces sur 5 ans afin de bâtir des mégaprisons à l’américaine.
201105,62,62420,783,NA,NA,Personne ne remet en cause le besoin d’imposer des peines aux criminels.
201105,62,62420,784,NA,NA,Mais se concentrer exclusivement à construire plus de prisons ne rendra pas nos communautés plus fortes ou sécuritaires. Cette approche a échoué aux États-Unis.
201105,62,62420,785,NA,NA,Tout indique qu’il en faudra bien plus que des prisons.

201105,62,62420,788,NA,NA,Treize pour cent des logements ont besoin d’importantes réparations ou ne sont pas conçus pour le nombre de personnes qu’ils abritent.
201105,62,62420,789,NA,NA,"Les données sont encore plus alarmantes lorsqu’il s’agit des personnes âgées et des nouveaux Canadiens, sans parler des sans-abri."
201105,62,62420,790,NA,NA,"Au même moment, le manque de logements abordables dans les grandes villes est un obstacle important pour les familles à revenu modeste qui cherchent une première maison."
201105,62,62420,791,NA,NA,"Quoiqu’un modeste financement public ait permis d’offrir de nouveaux logements abordables sur le marché, d’autres logements du même type disparaissent à un rythme deux fois plus rapide en raison notamment de l’embourgeoisement de certains quartiers, de la faiblesse des taux d’intérêt et de la demande toujours plus forte."
201105,62,62420,792,NA,NA,"Depuis quelques années, on ne peut plus compter sur le gouvernement fédéral au niveau des logements abordables."
201105,62,62420,793,NA,NA,Un engagement de partenariat à long terme avec les autres ordres de gouvernement est nécessaire.
201105,62,62420,794,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral travaillera avec ses partenaires provinciaux et municipaux afin de créer un nouveau cadre sur le logement abordable (CLA).
201105,62,62420,795,NA,NA,"Un cadre avait été élaboré il y a dix ans et plusieurs de ses programmes ont été prolongés, mais il fait présentement l'objet d'un examen par le gouvernement Harper."

201105,62,62420,798,NA,NA,~ maintenir et renouveler l'inventaire actuel de logements abordables; et
201105,62,62420,799,NA,NA,~ encourager la construction de nouveaux logements abordables.
201105,62,62420,800,NA,NA,Le nouveau cadre s'appuiera sur un engagement financier à long terme de la part du gouvernement fédéral et remplacera l'amalgame de programmes temporaires qui existe à l'heure actuelle.
201105,62,62420,801,NA,NA,L'ampleur de cet engagement à long terme dépendra du résultat des consultations avec les municipalités et de la situation financière globale du gouvernement dans les années à venir.
201105,62,62420,802,NA,NA,"Toutefois, au cours des deux premières années de son mandat, le gouvernement libéral augmentera de 550 millions de $ le financement fédéral pour la création de logements abordables."
201105,62,62420,803,NA,NA,"Dans chaque région, les défis et les opportunités qui sont liés au logement diffèrent."
201105,62,62420,804,NA,NA,"C'est pourquoi le nouveau cadre sur le logement abordable sera assez souple et flexible pour y inclure une gamme de nouvelles approches, dont des incitatifs fiscaux et des garanties d'emprunt."
201105,62,62420,805,NA,NA,"Le cadre servira aussi à faciliter la collaboration entre les différents ordres de gouvernement, le secteur privé et les organisations sans but lucratif."
201105,62,62420,806,NA,NA,"Le nouveau cadre portera une attention particulière aux besoins des personnes handicapées, ainsi des communautés autochtones et du Nord."

201105,62,62420,811,NA,NA,Les leaders à tous les niveaux doivent faire face à l’inégalité grandissante.
201105,62,62420,812,NA,NA,La pauvreté à l’échelle du pays persiste et reste un défi à relever.
201105,62,62420,813,NA,NA,"Elle prive les citoyens de chances équitables, elle nuit à la productivité de notre économie et elle porte atteinte à la confiance en notre système démocratique."

201105,62,62420,815,NA,NA,"Tous les Canadiens, y compris les entreprises, les individus, les experts et la société civile doivent s’engager dans ce combat."

201105,62,62420,818,NA,NA,Nous établirons des objectifs et des mesures pratiques pour les atteindre et définirons le rôle des partenaires.
201105,62,62420,819,NA,NA,Ce sera un plan à long terme.
201105,62,62420,820,NA,NA,"Plusieurs éléments clés de cette plate-forme seront la fondation du plan de réduction de la pauvreté au Canada, telles que la stratégie canadienne d'apprentissage, notamment quant à l'apprentissage et aux soins des jeunes enfants, au passeport canadien d'apprentissage pour favoriser l'accès aux études postsecondaires, à l'apprentissage pour les Autochtones; les soins familiaux; la revalorisation du bénévolat au moyen du Corps de service du Canada; la politique alimentaire nationale et le cadre sur le logement abordable."
201105,62,62420,821,NA,NA,"Ce sont autant de mesures pratiques, évaluées à plus de 5 milliards de $ sur deux ans, qui auront une incidence positive, surtout si elles s'inscrivent dans un effort pancanadien visant à dynamiser nos communautés en luttant contre la pauvreté et l'inégalité."
201105,62,62420,822,NA,NA,Elles contribueront aussi à renforcer l'économie à long terme.
201105,62,62420,824,NA,NA,"Nos communautés ont une dette morale envers les policiers, les pompiers et les autres travailleurs affectés aux services d’urgence qui souvent mettent leur propre vie en danger."

201105,62,62420,828,NA,NA,Les policiers consultent le registre des armes à feu en moyenne 11 000 fois par jour.
201105,62,62420,829,NA,NA,"Il n’est donc pas surprenant si l’Association des policiers du Canada, l’Association canadienne des chefs de police et l’Association canadienne des commissions de police appuient le registre, tout comme de nombreuses organisations qui militent en faveur de la santé et de la sécurité des femmes."
201105,62,62420,830,NA,NA,"Depuis la création du registre des armes d’épaule, plus de 90 pour cent des propriétaires ont enregistré leurs armes."
201105,62,62420,831,NA,NA,"Les Canadiens qui vivent en milieux ruraux et les propriétaires d’armes d’épaule ont néanmoins exprimé des frustrations et critiques légitimes quant aux coûts, à la lourdeur administrative et aux charges criminelles en cas d’infraction."
201105,62,62420,832,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral maintiendra l'intégrité du registre des armes à feu pour assurer la sécurité publique,"

201105,62,62420,836,NA,NA,"pas constituer une offense criminelle, mais devrait plutôt faire l'objet d'une amende en l'absence de facteurs aggravants."
201105,62,62420,837,NA,NA,Travaillant avec les provinces et les territoires afin d'effectuer ces changements permettra aux agents de première ligne d'avoir les outils légaux pour différencier les erreurs commises de bonne foi des menaces réelles envers la sécurité publique.

201105,62,62420,839,NA,NA,"3) Simplifier. Même si les demandes de permis sont disponibles en ligne, le système d'enregistrement demeure inaccessible pour bien des gens qui vivent en milieu rural et dans le Nord canadien."
201105,62,62420,840,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral simplifiera les formulaires et l'enregistrement et améliorera l'accès aux services d'enregistrement dans les comptoirs de Service Canada à travers le pays.
201105,62,62420,841,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement Harper a démontré qu’il accordait peu d’importance à l’opinion des forces policières à travers le pays et a fait de l’abolition du registre des armes d’épaule, l’un de ses chevaux de bataille."
201105,62,62420,842,NA,NA,Il en a résulté que des divisions que le Parti conservateur exploite à des fins partisanes.
201105,62,62420,843,NA,NA,Les libéraux continuent d'appuyer les forces policières du Canada.
201105,62,62420,844,NA,NA,Nous avons aussi répondu aux préoccupations légitimes par rapport au registre et nous nous sommes engagés à l'améliorer.
201105,62,62420,845,NA,NA,Cela donnera les outils nécessaires aux policiers afin qu'ils puissent faire leur travail et amenuisera les clivages entre les Canadiens qui vivent dans les villes et ceux qui vivent dans les régions rurales.

201105,62,62420,849,NA,NA,Harper a négligé de prendre des mesures efficaces pour corriger les problèmes de gestion de la GRC.
201105,62,62420,850,NA,NA,"Sur l’un des enjeux clés – celui d’assurer une surveillance civile – le gouvernement Harper a une fois de plus démontré son intolérance face aux critiques objectives et factuelles et n’a pas reconduit dans son poste le Commissaire aux plaintes de la GRC, qui a critiqué l’absence de progrès du gouvernement en matière de réformes."
201105,62,62420,851,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral agira afin de créer un comité de surveillance civile, rétablir la transparence et corriger les problèmes de gestion et de leadership au sein de la GRC."
201105,62,62420,852,NA,NA,"Les membres de la GRC d'hier, d'aujourd'hui et de demain ne doivent pas en attendre moins de leur gouvernement, car ils travaillent fort pour protéger leurs communautés à tous les jours."
201105,62,62420,853,NA,NA,Fonds des héros communautaires. Les représentants des policiers et des pompiers réclament depuis longtemps un fonds national pour reconnaître le service et le sacrifice des agents de la police et des incendies qui meurent dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions.
201105,62,62420,854,NA,NA,Un gouvernement libéral mettra sur pied le Fonds des héros communautaires.
201105,62,62420,855,NA,NA,"En versant la somme de 300 000 $ aux familles des agents décédés, le Fonds protégera l'avenir financier de ces familles tout en exprimant le respect et la reconnaissance de leurs communautés et de leur pays."

201105,62,62420,859,NA,NA,Les femmes autochtones sont tout particulièrement touchées par cette violence.
201105,62,62420,860,NA,NA,L’Association des femmes autochtones du Canada estime à plus de 580 le nombre des femmes autochtones disparues ou assassinées.
201105,62,62420,861,NA,NA,"Cela représente près de dix pour cent des femmes assassinées au Canada, alors que les femmes autochtones comptent pour seulement trois pour cent de la population féminine du pays."
201105,62,62420,862,NA,NA,Peu a été fait par le gouvernement fédéral pour remédier à cette situation tragique.
201105,62,62420,863,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement libéral mandatera un groupe d'étude national chargé d'examiner les causes systémiques de ce problème, en mettant l'accent sur leur élimination afin de prévenir que cette situation ne persiste à l'avenir."

201105,62,62420,865,NA,NA,Il fera rapport au ministre de la Justice en présentant une analyse de la situation et des recommandations.
201105,62,62420,867,NA,NA,Le bénévolat – l’action de donner de son temps et de ses énergies pour aider les autres – est vital à une société saine et à une démocratie vibrante.

201105,62,62420,877,NA,NA,Nous investirons un montant initial de 180 millions de $ sur 4 ans pour le nouveau Corps de service du Canada.
201105,62,62420,878,NA,NA,"De ces fonds, 20 millions de $ seront dédiés à la promotion et à l'augmentation des capacités du secteur bénévole."

201105,62,62420,882,NA,NA,Le reste de la somme - 160 millions de $ sur 4 ans - sera dédié à encourager le bénévolat chez les jeunes.

201105,62,62420,884,NA,NA,"Le service bénévole pourrait aussi se faire durant une année de relâche ou pendant les études, mais l'effacement de la dette dépendra de l'obtention du diplôme."
201105,62,62420,885,NA,NA,Cette initiative créera jusqu'à 26 000 postes bénévoles chaque année.
201105,62,62420,886,NA,NA,Le Corps de service du Canada travaillera de pair avec les secteurs sans but lucratif et bénévole afin de créer des postes de bénévoles au niveau national et international.
201105,62,62420,887,NA,NA,Il est temps de reconstruire une relation respectueuse et constructive entre le gouvernement fédéral et la société civile.
201105,62,62420,888,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement Harper a été particulièrement hostile envers les groupes bénévoles et communautaires et les ONG, surtout avec ceux qui ne partagent par son idéologie de droite. Cependant,"
201105,62,62420,889,NA,NA,une démocratie saine requiert une diversité de voix et d’opinions.
201105,62,62420,890,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement n’a pas besoin de partager leurs opinions tout le temps, mais il doit respecter le rôle important qu’ils jouent dans notre société."
201105,62,62420,891,NA,NA,"Plutôt que de tenter de contrôler le débat public, et faire taire les gens qui sont en désaccord avec lui, un gouvernement libéral respectera les différents groupes de la société civile et leur droit de faire avancer leur cause et de critiquer le gouvernement."

201105,62,62623,362,NA,NA,• supprimé des rôles d'imposition plus d'un million de Canadiens à faible revenu;
201105,62,62623,363,NA,NA,"• permis aux aînés de fractionner leur revenu de pension aux fins fiscales, permettant aux couples d'aînés d'économiser près de 1000 $ par année;"
201105,62,62623,364,NA,NA,• créé le Compte d'épargne libre d'impôt - l'outil d'épargne le plus important depuis les REER; et
201105,62,62623,365,NA,NA,"• réduit le fardeau fiscal des aînés, des étudiants, des usagers du transport en commun, des gens de métier, des nouveaux Canadiens et de toutes les familles canadiennes."
201105,62,62623,366,NA,NA,"En fait, depuis 2006, nous avons réduit le fardeau fiscal à 120 reprises, notamment par des mesures permettant à une famille moyenne de quatre d'économiser plus de 3 000 $ par année."
201105,62,62623,368,NA,NA,Mais il reste à faire.
201105,62,62623,369,NA,NA,Nous devons continuer à réduire le fardeau fiscal pour aider les Canadiens à subvenir aux besoins de leur famille et pour renforcer la sécurité financière des Canadiens.
201105,62,62623,370,NA,NA,Voici ce que fera un gouvernement conservateur réélu dirigé par Stephen Harper pour atteindre ces objectifs.
201105,62,62623,372,NA,NA,Le gouvernement de Stephen Harper a agi pour soutenir toutes les familles canadiennes.
201105,62,62623,374,NA,NA,"• créé la Prestation universelle pour la garde d'enfants, offrant 1 200 $ par année, pour chaque enfant de moins de 6 ans, afin de soutenir tous les parents et de respecter leur droit de choisir le type de garde qui convient le mieux à leur famille;"
201105,62,62623,375,NA,NA,"• créé le Crédit d'impôt pour enfants, un crédit d'impôt de 2 000 $ pour chaque enfant de moins de 18 ans;"
201105,62,62623,376,NA,NA,"• créé le Crédit d'impôt pour la condition physique des enfants, pour aider les familles à supporter les coûts d'inscription à des activités sportives et d'autres activités physiques;"
201105,62,62623,377,NA,NA,• amélioré le Régime enregistré d'épargne-études;
201105,62,62623,378,NA,NA,• créé le Régime enregistré d'épargne-invalidité pour aider les Canadiens ayant une invalidité et leur famille à planifier l'avenir ; et
201105,62,62623,379,NA,NA,"• pris d'autres mesures d'allégement fiscal majeures, visant souvent les familles à faible revenu."
201105,62,62623,380,NA,NA,"Ce bilan indique que nous croyons fermement à une équité pour les familles canadiennes, et au respect des choix qu'elles font en fonction de leurs besoins et de leurs priorités."
201105,62,62623,381,NA,NA,"Mais il reste à faire, surtout avec le régime d'imposition du revenu fédéral."
201105,62,62623,382,NA,NA,"Pour le moment, des couples ayant le même nombre d'enfants et gagnant le même revenu total ne sont pas traités sur un pied d'égalité."
201105,62,62623,383,NA,NA,Un couple à deux revenus dont l'un des partenaires gagne plus que l'autre paie plus d'impôt fédéral qu'un couple dont les deux partenaires ont le même revenu.
201105,62,62623,384,NA,NA,Un couple gagnant un seul revenu paie encore plus d'impôt.
201105,62,62623,385,NA,NA,Nous pourrons bientôt prendre une mesure historique pour assurer une plus grande équité aux familles.
201105,62,62623,386,NA,NA,Nous allons offrir un allégement fiscal pour les familles: le fractionnement du revenu des couples ayant des enfants à charge de moins de 18 ans.
201105,62,62623,387,NA,NA,"Cela donnera aux couples le choix de fractionner jusqu'à 50 000 $ du revenu familial, aux fins de l'imposition fédérale."
201105,62,62623,388,NA,NA,"Cette importante nouvelle mesure sera prise quand le budget sera équilibré, au cours de notre prochain mandat."
201105,62,62623,389,NA,NA,"Le résultat sera un allégement fiscal considérable pour quelque 1,8 million de familles canadiennes - chacune économisant en moyenne 1300 $ par année."
201105,62,62623,390,NA,NA,"En outre, cela assurera que le régime fiscal fédéral respecte et soutient les choix faits par les familles."
201105,62,62623,391,NA,NA,Cela assurera une équité pour les couples gagnant un seul revenu.
201105,62,62623,392,NA,NA,"Et cela réduira le fardeau des familles à deux revenus, qui pourront garder une plus grande part de ce qu'elles gagnent et mieux bénéficier du deuxième revenu."
201105,62,62623,394,NA,NA,Les parents savent qu'une activité physique régulière est un élément clé du développement de leurs enfants.
201105,62,62623,395,NA,NA,"Que ce soit du hockey ou de la danse, cela permet aux enfants de commencer une vie saine et active."
201105,62,62623,396,NA,NA,"Cependant, le coût de ces mesures peut exercer une pression sur le budget familial."
201105,62,62623,397,NA,NA,"En 2007, le gouvernement de Stephen Harper a créé le Crédit d'impôt pour la condition physique des enfants, qui s'élève à 500 $, pour aider les familles à supporter ces coûts."
201105,62,62623,398,NA,NA,"En 2008, près de 1,5 million de Canadiens ont bénéficié de cette mesure."
201105,62,62623,399,NA,NA,"En raison du succès de cette mesure, nous allons doubler la valeur du crédit d'impôt et le rendre remboursable, jusqu'à 1000 $, pour aider à supporter les coûts d'inscription des enfants à des activités physiques."
201105,62,62623,400,NA,NA,"Cette mesure sera prise quand le budget sera équilibré, au cours de notre prochain mandat."
201105,62,62623,402,NA,NA,"Pour de nombreux enfants canadiens, la participation aux arts fait partie intégrante de leur développement."
201105,62,62623,403,NA,NA,"Un enfant aime les camps musicaux, un autre est attiré par les planches, et un autre apprend la langue et le patrimoine de ses ancêtres."
201105,62,62623,404,NA,NA,Tous peuvent ainsi se faire des amis et développer leur créativité.
201105,62,62623,405,NA,NA,"Cependant, les coûts connexes peuvent être trop élevés pour certaines familles."
201105,62,62623,406,NA,NA,"Dans le but d'aider les familles à offrir ces importantes possibilités à leurs enfants, nous allons créer le Crédit d'impôt pour les activités artistiques des enfants, supportant les dépenses admissibles de 500 $ par enfant participant à des activités artistiques ou culturelles."
201105,62,62623,408,NA,NA,Les Canadiens de tout âge veulent être en bonne forme physique.
201105,62,62623,409,NA,NA,Cela aide à éviter de graves maladies chroniques et à améliorer le bien-être.
201105,62,62623,410,NA,NA,Une vaste gamme d'activités peut permettre d'atteindre ces objectifs - du hockey à la course à pied.
201105,62,62623,411,NA,NA,"Pour aider les Canadiens à choisir un mode de vie sain et actif, nous allons offrir le Crédit d'impôt pour la condition physique des adultes, couvrant jusqu'à 500 $ des frais d'inscription à des activités physiques pour adultes."
201105,62,62623,412,NA,NA,"Cette mesure sera prise quand le budget sera équilibré, au cours de notre prochain mandat."
201105,62,62623,414,NA,NA,"En 2007, le gouvernement de Stephen Harper a créé le programme écoÉNERGIE Rénovation - Maisons afin de soutenir des projets permettant d'économiser l'énergie."
201105,62,62623,415,NA,NA,Cette initiative vise à aider à réduire les coûts énergétiques des Canadiens et à avoir un environnement plus propre.
201105,62,62623,416,NA,NA,"Le programme offre aux propriétaires fonciers une subvention pouvant atteindre 5 000 $ afin de compenser le coût des améliorations efficaces sur le plan énergétique - par exemple, remplacer le système de chauffage ou de climatisation, ou des portes et des fenêtres."
201105,62,62623,417,NA,NA,Nous allons prolonger d'un an le programme écoÉNERGIE Rénovation - Maisons.
201105,62,62623,418,NA,NA,Ce nouvel investissement aidera les familles à réduire les coûts énergétiques et soutiendra l'emploi dans le secteur de la rénovation domiciliaire.
201105,62,62623,420,NA,NA,"Les Canadiens sont des gens occupés - ils travaillent fort, ils s'occupent de leur famille et ils contribuent à leur communauté."
201105,62,62623,421,NA,NA,"Nombre d'individus et de familles ont des responsabilités supplémentaires, car ils doivent prendre soin de parents ou de proches infirmes."
201105,62,62623,422,NA,NA,"Ces aidants familiaux font des sacrifices, devant souvent quitter temporairement leur travail, renonçant à un revenu d'emploi."
201105,62,62623,423,NA,NA,"Dans le but de reconnaître et de soutenir les Canadiens qui s'occupent de proches handicapés à la maison, nous allons créer le Crédit d'impôt pour aidants familiaux de 2 000 $."
201105,62,62623,424,NA,NA,Cette nouvelle mesure bénéficiera à plus de 500 000 aidants familiaux.
201105,62,62623,425,NA,NA,"Elle inclura pour la première fois les conjoints, conjoints de faits et enfants mineurs, et elle visera à améliorer les crédits existants pour personnes à charge afin de maximiser le soutien aux aidants familiaux."
201105,62,62623,427,NA,NA,"Les aînés canadiens méritent notre gratitude, ayant contribué toute leur vie à nos familles, nos communautés et notre pays."
201105,62,62623,428,NA,NA,Ils méritent de terminer leur vie dans la dignité.
201105,62,62623,429,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement de Stephen Harper a pris des mesures pour soutenir nos aînés, y compris les aînés à faible revenu."
201105,62,62623,431,NA,NA,augmenté le Montant en raison de l'âge - à deux reprises - haussant le revenu pouvant être gagné avant de payer de l'impôt;
201105,62,62623,432,NA,NA,• permis aux couples âgés de partager leur revenu de pension aux fins de l'impôt;
201105,62,62623,433,NA,NA,"• investi 400 millions de dollars dans des logements pour les aînés à faible revenu, dans le cadre de notre Plan d'action économique; et"
201105,62,62623,434,NA,NA,• augmenté le montant que les bénéficiaires du SRG peuvent gagner avant que leurs prestations soient réduites.
201105,62,62623,435,NA,NA,Mais il faut faire plus.
201105,62,62623,436,NA,NA,"Bien que le niveau de pauvreté chez les aînés au Canada soit bas relativement à d'autres pays, cela ne suffit pas."
201105,62,62623,437,NA,NA,"Dans des communautés partout au pays, des aînés ont de la difficulté à payer leurs factures mensuelles."
201105,62,62623,438,NA,NA,"Ce sont souvent des femmes, et souvent des veufs."
201105,62,62623,439,NA,NA,"Ils ont travaillé fort toute leur vie pour leur famille et leur communauté, mais n'ont pas de revenu de retraite."
201105,62,62623,440,NA,NA,"Pour offrir un meilleur soutien aux aînés les plus vulnérables, nous allons verser une prestation complémentaire au Supplément de revenu garanti, offrant jusqu'à 600 $ de plus par année aux aînés célibataires et jusqu'à 840 $ aux couples."
201105,62,62623,441,NA,NA,"Nous estimons que cette mesure améliorera la sécurité financière de quelque 680 000 aînés canadiens, les aidant à joindre les deux bouts."
201105,62,62623,445,NA,NA,de leurs épargnes - avoir suffisamment d'argent de côté pour l'éducation de leurs enfants et un coussin pour leur retraite.
201105,62,62623,446,NA,NA,"Dans le but d'aider les Canadiens à épargner plus pour l'avenir, notre gouvernement a créé en 2008 le Compte d'épargne libre d'impôt (CELI)."
201105,62,62623,447,NA,NA,Le CELI est l'outil d'épargne personnelle plus important depuis les REER.
201105,62,62623,448,NA,NA,"Cette mesure remporte un franc succès - environ 4,7 millions de Canadiens ont un CELI."
201105,62,62623,449,NA,NA,Et cela profite particulièrement aux aînés - ils peuvent retirer de l'argent sans que cela affecte leurs prestations de SV ou du SRG.
201105,62,62623,450,NA,NA,"Nous allons tirer profit de ce succès en doublant le montant que les Canadiens peuvent épargner chaque année, le portant à 10 000 $."
201105,62,62623,451,NA,NA,"Cette mesure sera prise quand le budget sera équilibré, au cours de notre prochain mandat."
201105,62,62623,453,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement de Stephen Harper offre un allégement fiscal considérable aux aînés et aux pensionnés, aidant à assurer qu'ils ont une bonne qualité de vie."

201105,62,62623,455,NA,NA,"De nombreux Canadiens se demandent s'ils épargnent suffisamment pour leur retraite, et la plupart des travailleurs canadiens n'ont pas accès à un régime de retraite."
201105,62,62623,456,NA,NA,"À la fin de l'année dernière, le gouvernement de Stephen Harper a annoncé un plan visant à aider les Canadiens à épargner pour leur retraite, ce qui comprend les travailleurs autonomes, par une option de pension à faible coût."
201105,62,62623,457,NA,NA,Un gouvernement conservateur réélu collaborera avec ses partenaires provinciaux et territoriaux pour mettre en place le Régime de pension agréé collectif le plus rapidement possible au cours de son prochain mandat.
201105,62,62623,459,NA,NA,Les hommes et les femmes en uniforme qui servent notre pays méritent notre profonde gratitude et notre plus grand respect.

201105,62,62623,471,NA,NA,Nous allons investir dans un programme de transition vers le marché du travail afin d'aider les anciens militaires à trouver du travail dans l'industrie de la construction.

201105,62,62623,788,NA,NA,"De plus, nous traitons les droits des victimes en priorité dans nos réformes du système de justice. ."
201105,62,62623,790,NA,NA,"• mis un terme à la réduction des peines en cas de meurtres multiples, parce que chaque victime compte, et parce que leurs familles ne devraient pas avoir l'impression que la vie d'un être cher ne compte pas;"

201105,62,62623,795,NA,NA,et pour défendre les droits des victimes de crime.
201105,62,62623,796,NA,NA,"Selon le Code criminel actuel, les tribunaux sont censés imposer une suramende compensatoire aux criminels reconnus coupables - une amende pour aider à financer les services de soutien aux victimes dans chaque province."

201105,62,62623,798,NA,NA,Les criminels s'en tirent à bon compte et les services de soutien aux victimes ne sont pas bien financés.

201105,62,62623,804,NA,NA,"Cette mesure sera financée par les recettes générales, pas par les cotisations à l'AE."
201105,62,62623,805,NA,NA,"En reconnaissance du fait que la perte ou la maladie grave d'un enfant est l'une des pires expériences qu'un parent puisse vivre, ces prestations aideront les parents pendant la période la plus difficile de leur vie."
201105,62,62623,807,NA,NA,La consommation de drogue chez les détenus réduit considérablement leurs chances de réadaptation.

201105,62,62623,816,NA,NA,On estime qu'environ deux millions de personnes sont vendues et achetées dans le monde chaque année.
201105,62,62623,817,NA,NA,"Les victimes, le plus souvent des femmes et des enfants vulnérables, sont principalement utilisées pour le commerce sexuel."
201105,62,62623,818,NA,NA,On estime que de 12 000 à 15 000 personnes au Canada sont victimes de la traite de personnes.
201105,62,62623,819,1,0,Le gouvernement de Stephen Harper a pris des mesures pour lutter contre ce problème.

201105,62,62623,823,NA,NA,Nous passons maintenant aux étapes suivantes.
201105,62,62623,825,NA,NA,• élaborer et exécuter un Plan d'action national pour combattre la traite de personnes;

201105,62,62623,827,2,1,"• aider à assurer que les immigrantes âgées de 15 à 21 ans qui entrent seules au Canada ne sont pas sujettes à un travail illégal ou non sécuritaire - dans le cas des personnes à haut risque, nous allons, pendant les six premiers mois de leur séjour, assurer un contact régulier avec l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada."
201105,62,62623,828,1,1,"Nous allons également présenter de nouveau une mesure législative visant à protéger les travailleurs étrangers vulnérables - par exemple, les femmes qui entrent au Canada pour travailler comme danseuses exotiques."
201105,62,62623,829,2,1,"Cette mesure législative donnera aux agents de l'immigration un pouvoir accru de refuser l'octroi de permis de travail aux personnes envoyées au Canada pour travailler dans des conditions humiliantes ou dégradantes, notamment les victimes potentielles de la traite de personnes."
201105,62,62623,831,NA,NA,Le gouvernement de Stephen Harper a pris des mesures pour faire de la protection de la société un principe fondamental des systèmes de justice et correctionnel.
201105,62,62623,832,NA,NA,"De plus, nous travaillons fort pour défendre les droits des victimes de crime."
201105,62,62623,833,NA,NA,"Par exemple, nous avons adopté une mesure législative visant à mettre un terme à la pratique consistant à imposer des périodes concurrentes d'inadmissibilité à la libération conditionnelle - la réduction des peines - en cas de meurtres multiples."
201105,62,62623,834,NA,NA,"Chaque victime compte, et il ne faut pas que le système traite les victimes et leurs familles comme si elles ne comptaient pas."
201105,62,62623,835,NA,NA,"Nous devons également prendre des mesures pour garder les dangereux criminels derrière les barreaux, là où est leur place."
201105,62,62623,836,NA,NA,"Nous allons élargir la portée de ce principe par une mesure législative visant à mettre un terme à la réduction des peines en cas d'agressions sexuelles multiples contre des enfants et de pornographie juvénile, ce qui comprend la fabrication, la possession et l'utilisation de pornographie juvénile."
201105,62,62623,837,NA,NA,"Nous allons assurer que la société est mieux protégée contre ces criminels, et que les peines reflètent mieux l'effet dévastateur de ces crimes haineux sur la vie des enfants et de leurs familles."
201105,62,62623,839,NA,NA,Les Canadiens reconnaissent que la priorité première du système de justice devrait être la protection de la société - en particulier ses membres les plus vulnérables.
201105,62,62623,840,NA,NA,Et les Canadiens reconnaissent que nous devons tout mettre en œuvre pour protéger et honorer ceux qui ont bâti notre grand pays.
201105,62,62623,841,NA,NA,"Les Canadiens âgés méritent notre gratitude pour une vie de travail assidu au service de nos familles, de nos communautés et de notre pays."

201105,62,62623,843,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement de Stephen Harper a déjà pris des mesures pour défendre les Canadiens âgés qui sont victimes de fraude, dans le cadre des efforts déployés pour nous attaquer au crime en col blanc."
201105,62,62623,844,NA,NA,Mais il reste à faire.
201105,62,62623,845,NA,NA,"Dans le but d'aider à protéger les Canadiens âgés et d'assurer que ces crimes sont punis de façon appropriée, nous allons modifier le Code criminel pour y ajouter la vulnérabilité due à l'âge comme facteur aggravant au moment de l'imposition des peines."
201105,62,62623,848,NA,NA,Les Canadiens ont le droit de se défendre et de défendre leurs biens.

201105,62,62623,851,NA,NA,"Cependant, la police ne peut pas être partout à la fois."
201105,62,62623,852,NA,NA,"Depuis quelques années, la justice penche trop souvent en faveur des droits des criminels, au détriment des honnêtes citoyens."
201105,62,62623,853,NA,NA,"Le cas du commerçant de Toronto David Chen illustre très bien cette situation: quand un Canadien qui travaille fort peut être accusé et poursuivi en justice parce qu'il a arrêté un criminel qui ne cessait de le dévaliser, le moment est venu de passer à l'action."
201105,62,62623,854,NA,NA,"Un gouvernement conservateur réélu présentera de nouveau la Loi sur l'arrestation par un citoyen et sur la légitime défense - une mesure législative visant à clarifier les dispositions du Code criminel sur la légitime défense et la défense des biens,"
201105,62,62623,855,NA,NA,et à élargir les circonstances dans lesquelles les Canadiens peuvent procéder à une arrestation.
201105,62,62623,857,NA,NA,La contrebande de tabac est devenue une industrie massive du marché noir qui entraîne d'énormes pertes de revenus.

201105,62,62623,1035,NA,NA,"Par exemple, nous avons pris des mesures relativement à l'Article 28 de l'OMC afin de limiter les importations de concentrés de protéines du lait, et nous avons établi des normes sur la composition du fromage pour assurer que du vrai lait est utilisé dans la fabrication."

201105,62,62623,1107,NA,NA,"Les partis politiques bénéficient d'avantages considérables par rapport à d'autres organisations, notamment d'important incitatifs fiscaux pour les donateurs et le remboursement des fonds dépensés aux paliers national et local."
201105,62,62623,1108,NA,NA,"De plus, le gouvernement libéral précédent a créé une subvention directe pour les partis politiques - même pour les partis qui ne font rien pour recueillir des fonds par eux-mêmes."
201105,62,62623,1109,NA,NA,"l'année dernière seulement, cette subvention a coûté 27 millions de dollars aux contribuables."

201105,62,62901,8,NA,NA,"D'ici là, pour ce qui se décide encore à Ottawa, le Québec a besoin de représentants et représentantes qui pensent d'abord aux intérêts du Québec lorsqu'ils prennent une décision."
201105,62,62901,9,NA,NA,"C'est ce double rôle que jouent les députées et députés du Bloc Québécois : d'une part, promouvoir et préparer la souveraineté; de l'autre, défendre les intérêts, les droits et les valeurs du Québec à Ottawa."
201105,62,62901,11,NA,NA,"Les Québécoises et les Québécois forment une nation unie par une langue, une culture, une histoire, un désir de vivre ensemble et d'ériger sa propre société sur le territoire québécois."

201105,62,62901,15,NA,NA,"Depuis 1982, lorsque les Canadiens ont rapatrié et amendé leur Constitution malgré et contre le Québec, il n'y a pas de projet canadien qui tient compte de l'existence de la nation québécoise."
201105,62,62901,16,NA,NA,"Avec l'échec de l'accord du lac Meech en 1990, qui a entraîné la création du Bloc Québécois il est devenu évident que le Canada n'est pas en mesure de trouver une réponse satisfaisante à la question québécoise."

201105,62,62901,19,NA,NA,Les partis canadiens en sont le reflet.
201105,62,62901,20,NA,NA,"De l'autre, la nation québécoise a pris en main sa propre société et a commencé à la développer selon son propre savoir-faire, en fonction de ses propres aspirations et valeurs, de ses propres atouts."
201105,62,62901,21,NA,NA,C'est ce courant qu'incarne le Bloc Québécois.

201105,62,62901,28,NA,NA,Les partis canadiens n'ont pas encore pris la mesure des changements qui se sont opérés au Québec depuis 4-0 ans.
201105,62,62901,29,NA,NA,"Près de 30 ans après l'exclusion du Québec de la Constitution canadienne, 20 ans après l'échec de Meech, quatre ans après avoir supposément reconnu l'existence de notre nation, il leur est dorénavant impossible d'obtenir l'adhésion du Québec sans tenir compte de ce que sont aujourd'hui les Québécoises et les Québécois."
201105,62,62901,31,NA,NA,"Il arrive que les intérêts du Québec soient semblables à ceux du Canada, mais quand ils ne sont pas les mêmes, la population québécoise s'attend à ce que ceux qui parlent en son nom se rangent du côté des intérêts du Québec."

201105,62,62901,35,NA,NA,"Seuls les députés et députées du Bloc Québécois, libres de toute attache envers le monde financier de Toronto, l'industrie pétrolière albertaine ou les groupes de pression de toutes sortes au Canada anglais, ont les coudées franches pour représenter fidèlement le Québec."

201105,62,62901,47,NA,NA,"Pour assouvir leurs propres ambitions, ils demanderont à la nation québécoise de rentrer dans le rang et de se fondre dans leur parti."
201105,62,62901,48,NA,NA,"Ils inviteront la population québécoise à faire confiance à leurs candidats même si, dès le lendemain de l'élection, ils diront à leurs députés québécois de faire passer les intérêts du Canada avant ceux du Québec."
201105,62,62901,49,NA,NA,"Cette position, la nation québécoise ne peut plus l'accepter."
201105,62,62901,50,NA,NA,"C'est pourquoi, à chaque élection depuis sa création, le Bloc Québécois représente la majorité des circonscriptions du Québec."
201105,62,62901,51,NA,NA,La présence d'un fort contingent de députées et députés qui défendent exclusivement les intérêts du Québec est le résultat normal du développement du Québec.
201105,62,62901,52,NA,NA,"En cela, la force du Bloc Québécois n'est pas un accident de l'histoire ou le reflet d'une saute d'humeur passagère."
201105,62,62901,53,NA,NA,"C'est plutôt un fait de l'histoire, fruit du développement du Québec et de sa conscience nationale."
201105,62,62901,55,NA,NA,"Dans un régime parlementaire, le Parlement est l'unique détenteur de la légitimité démocratique et le gouvernement est en quelque sorte son employé. L'arme du Bloc Québécois, c'est la démocratie."
201105,62,62901,56,NA,NA,Elle doit bien fonctionner pour que les élus puissent bien représenter leur monde.
201105,62,62901,57,NA,NA,Un gouvernement qui tente de jouer au bras de fer avec le Parlement a un comportement contraire au bon fonctionnement d'un régime parlementaire.
201105,62,62901,58,NA,NA,Il ne peut qu'affaiblir la démocratie et provoquer des tensions inutiles et malsaines.
201105,62,62901,59,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois entend lutter ferme pour contrer tout affaiblissement des institutions démocratiques, tout abus de pouvoir de la part du gouvernement, toute atteinte à l'autonomie des nstitutions indépendantes, toute restriction indue dans l'accès à l'information et toute embûche dans la capacité des élus du peuple de bien représenter la population."
201105,62,62901,60,NA,NA,"Tant que le Québec fera partie du Canada et que la population québécoise paiera des impôts fédéraux, la population du Québec aura droit à des députés qui la représentent fidèlement."
201105,62,62901,61,NA,NA,C'est à cette condition que la voix du Québec sera forte et c'est le rôle que les députés du Bloc Québécois entendent jouer
201105,62,62901,63,NA,NA,"Comme il l'a fait lors de chaque élection, le Bloc Québécois dévoile dans la présente plateforme électorale l'ensemble des positions qu'il entend défendre au cours de la prochaine législature."

201105,62,62901,80,NA,NA,"Par exemple, au Québec, qui représente plus de 35 % des exportations canadiennes de haute technologie, les industries de pointe sont beaucoup plus présentes qu'au Canada."
201105,62,62901,81,NA,NA,"Comme le développement d'un produit de haute technologie prend du temps et coûte cher, le soutien gouvernemental à la recherche et au développement (R-D) est crucial."
201105,62,62901,82,NA,NA,"Mais puisque ces entreprises sont moins présentes au Canada qu'au Québec, le Canada est, parmi les pays industrialisés, l'un de ceux qui soutiennent le moins la recherche et le développement en entreprise."
201105,62,62901,83,NA,NA,"Sa base économique étant tournée vers autre chose, ce n'est pas son intérêt."
201105,62,62901,84,NA,NA,"Autre exemple, dans son plan de relance de 14 milliards de dollars, Ottawa a injecté près de 10 milliards pour secourir l'industrie ontarienne de l'automobile. C'est dans l'intérêt du Canada."
201105,62,62901,85,NA,NA,"Cependant, il n'accordait qu'un maigre 170 millions de dollars à l'industrie forestière, fortement présente au Québec."
201105,62,62901,86,NA,NA,"Par ailleurs, en matière environnementale et énergétique, nos intérêts sont aux antipodes."
201105,62,62901,87,NA,NA,Le Canada est une nation pétrolière.
201105,62,62901,88,NA,NA,"C'est de l'exploitation massive des sables bitumineux qu'il puise sa richesse, au point où la valeur du pétrodollar canadien varie selon les cours du pétrole."
201105,62,62901,89,NA,NA,"Au contraire, le pétrole appauvrit le Québec et, quand son prix monte, il nous ruine."
201105,62,62901,90,NA,NA,"De plus, le Québec a tout pour devenir le champion de l'après-pétrole."
201105,62,62901,91,NA,NA,"Il produit une énergie abondante et propre et, plutôt que de fabriquer des automobiles comme l'Ontario, il fabrique des trains, des métros et des autobus."
201105,62,62901,92,NA,NA,Le gouvernement Harper a été au service de l'industrie pétrolière depuis son élection.
201105,62,62901,93,NA,NA,Et Michael Ignatieff dans tout cela ?
201105,62,62901,94,NA,NA,"Estimant que le soutien à l'industrie pétrolière est « une question d'unité nationale», il commentait : « La chose la plus stupide que vous puissiez faire est de combattre une industrie qui procure des centaines de milliers d'emplois aux Canadiens.»"

201105,62,62901,96,NA,NA,"Ainsi, le Canada a tout intérêt à rester enfermé dans le 20e siècle, lors duquel il était payant de polluer et coûteux de protéger l'environnement."
201105,62,62901,97,NA,NA,"Au Québec, c'est le contraire."
201105,62,62901,98,NA,NA,"Comme notre base économique est différente, nos intérêts en matière commerciale sont différents."
201105,62,62901,99,NA,NA,Le Canada compte sur ses exportations de pétrole et de gaz pour améliorer sa balance commerciale et cherche à libéraliser le commerce tous azimuts au détriment des considérations environnementales et sociales.

201105,62,62901,102,NA,NA,Il est nécessaire de poser des gestes afin que les entreprises québécoises ne soient pas victimes de concurrence déloyale.
201105,62,62901,103,NA,NA,"De plus, la base agricole canadienne repose sur des fermes de taille industrielle pratiquant la monoculture d'exportation."
201105,62,62901,104,NA,NA,"Aussi, le Canada a intérêt à ce que les marchés agricoles soient complètement ouverts."
201105,62,62901,105,NA,NA,"Au Québec, nos fermes familiales sont majoritairement destinées à nourrir notre propre population, notamment les productions sous gestion de l'offre."
201105,62,62901,106,NA,NA,Nous avons donc besoin que les États préservent une part de souveraineté sur le plan alimentaire.

201105,62,62901,133,NA,NA,Notre message au Canada est simple: ne touchez pas à la culture québécoise!
201105,62,62901,134,NA,NA,"À cet effet, le Bloc Québécois demandera pour le Québec un droit de retrait avec pleine compensation de tous les programmes fédéraux visant à investir dans le domaine culturel et, à terme, un rapatriement des points d'impôts correspondant au gouvernement du Québec;"

201105,62,62901,139,NA,NA,"Cela implique un important transfert de pouvoirs et de ressources d'Ottawa vers Québec et de cesser d'invoquer que son pouvoir de dépenser n'est pas délimité par le partage des compétences pour s'ingérer dans la vie interne de la société québécoise, sans égard pour les champs de compétence exclusifs où le Québec devrait être déjà souverain;"

201105,62,62901,176,NA,NA,Il n'appartient pas au Parlement fédéral de décider du statut politique du Québec.
201105,62,62901,177,NA,NA,"De la même façon, un vote lors d'une élection fédérale ne peut pas être un vote sur la souveraineté."
201105,62,62901,178,NA,NA,"En revanche, il peut être un vote pour élire des députés et députées souverainistes."
201105,62,62901,179,NA,NA,"Tout en travaillant dans le plus profond respect du Canada et de ses institutions, le Bloc Québécois agit de deux façons en faveur de la souveraineté : il fait sa promotion et travaille à sa préparation."
201105,62,62901,180,NA,NA,"Voué à la défense des intérêts du Québec à la Chambre des communes, le Bloc Québécois est à même de constater et d'exposer que les intérêts du Québec diffèrent souvent de ceux du Canada."
201105,62,62901,181,NA,NA,"De plus, comme le Bloc Québécois porte systématiquement à Ottawa les consensus québécois exprimés par les résolutions unanimes de l'Assemblée nationale du Québec, la population québécoise peut prendre acte du fait que la Chambre des communes rejette souvent sans ménagement les positions du Québec."
201105,62,62901,182,NA,NA,Voilà deux démonstrations en faveur de la souveraineté que les députées et députés du Bloc Québécois font quotidiennement en effectuant un travail rigoureux et en représentant fidèlement la population qui les a élus.
201105,62,62901,183,NA,NA,"Voué au progrès du Québec, le Bloc Québécois tente par tous les moyens de le rendre plus fort et plus libre."
201105,62,62901,184,NA,NA,"Or, chaque pan d'autonomie que le Québec gagne est un pan de souveraineté supplémentaire."
201105,62,62901,185,NA,NA,"De plus, chaque gain du Québec est susceptible de rendre la nation québécoise plus confiante en ses moyens."
201105,62,62901,186,NA,NA,"Autrement dit, en faisant avancer le Québec, le travail du Bloc Québécois le rapproche de sa souveraineté."
201105,62,62901,187,NA,NA,Mais la contribution du Bloc Québécois au mouvement souverainiste va plus loin.
201105,62,62901,188,NA,NA,Il a développé une expertise dans les domaines propres aux pays souverains et mis cette expertise au service du Québec.
201105,62,62901,189,NA,NA,"Ainsi, il a su déterminer quels sont les intérêts du Québec dans des questions comme les affaires étrangères, la défense, le commerce international, les politiques macroéconomiques, les grands enjeux environnementaux et de justice et les relations avec les peuples autochtones."
201105,62,62901,190,NA,NA,Autant de champs d'expertise dont un Québec souverain aura grand besoin.
201105,62,62901,191,NA,NA,"Au fil des ans, le Bloc Québécois a d'ailleurs puissamment contribué à nourrir le mouvement souverainiste par ses chantiers de réflexion sur des questions comme la mondialisation, les intérêts stratégiques du Québec en matière d'économie ou la citoyenneté."
201105,62,62901,192,NA,NA,"Grâce à ce travail parfois discret mais toujours important, le Québec est aujourd'hui mieux préparé que jamais pour assumer l'ensemble des responsabilités d'un pays souverain."
201105,62,62901,193,NA,NA,"Finalement, parsa présence au Parlement fédéral, le Bloc Québécois peut passer outre le cadenas diplomatique qu'Ottawa impose au Québec et lui ouvrir les portes du monde."
201105,62,62901,194,NA,NA,"En effet, les députées et députés du Bloc Québécois jouissent d'un accès privilégié à leurs collègues du reste du monde et aux diplomates étrangers, et ils utilisent cet accès pour présenter le Québec défendre ses intérêts et faire valoir ses positions."
201105,62,62901,195,NA,NA,"Ainsi, plusieurs pays sont aujourd'hui à même de réaliser qu'un Québec souverain serait leur allié dans plusieurs domaines, ce qui facilitera la tâche du gouvernement du Québec lorsque la population québécoise lui donnera le mandat d'établir des relations diplomatiques avec eux."
201105,62,62901,196,NA,NA,"Pour la reconnaissance internationale du Québec, le travail du Bloc Québécois est irremplaçable."
201105,62,62901,197,NA,NA,"1.2.2 le Bloc Québécois croit fermement que la nation québécoise choisira, le moment venu, d'adopter elle-même toutes ses lois, de percevoir et gérer elle-même tous ses impôts et de conclure tous ses traités,"

201105,62,62901,200,NA,NA,"Advenant l'élection d'un gouvernement souverainiste à l'Assemblée nationale du Québec, le Bloc Québécois se fera porte-parole à la Chambre des communes et promoteur, partout au Québec, au Canada et sur la scène internationale, des aspirations souverainistes et des revendications de ce gouvernement souverainiste."
201105,62,62901,202,NA,NA,La classe politique canadienne ne peut pas répondre aux désirs de reconnaissance réelle et d'autonomie que le Québec formule depuis un demi-siècle.
201105,62,62901,203,NA,NA,"D'une part, elle n'en a pas envie."
201105,62,62901,204,NA,NA,"D'autre part, même si elle le désirait, la population canadienne ne l'accepterait pas."
201105,62,62901,205,NA,NA,"Aussi, dans le climat de panique qui a suivi le résultat serré exprimé lors du référendum de 1995, Ottawa a tenté de rendre illégal le projet souverainiste en changeant les règles du jeu démocratique."
201105,62,62901,206,NA,NA,"Dans un premier temps, le gouvernement fédéral s'est adressé à la Cour suprême, espérant qu'elle déclare que le projet souverainiste est illégal."
201105,62,62901,207,NA,NA,0 surprise! La Cour a plutôt estimé que notre projet était légitime et qu'en plus « la répudiation claire de l'ordre constitutionnel existant et l'expression claire par la population d'une province du désir de réaliser la sécession donnent naissance à une obligation réciproque pourtoutes les parties formant la Confédération de négocier des modifications constitutionnelles en vue de répondre au désir exprimé».
201105,62,62901,208,NA,NA,"Même si cette obligation de négocier garantissait une transition ordonnée dans le meilleur intérêt du Québec comme du Canada, Ottawa a plutôt décidé de s'en soustraire en adoptant une loi, ironiquement nommée Loi sur la clarté référendaire."

201105,62,62901,711,NA,NA,Une autre position idéologique des conservateurs a été révélée au grand jour.
201105,62,62901,712,NA,NA,Coup sur coup ils ont refusé d'intervenir auprès des États-Unis pour demander que la peine de mort d'un Canadien soit commuée en peine de prison à vie et ont décliné l'invitation qui leur était faite de parrainer une résolution présentée à l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies demandant un moratoire sur ce châtiment cruel.

201105,62,62901,715,NA,NA,Le gouvernement fédéral doit lutter plus efficacement contre la contrebande d'armes puisque près de 50 % des armes de poing trouvées sur les lieux des crimes sont des armes qui sont vraisemblablement entrées illégalement au Canada.

201105,62,62901,722,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois est fier d'avoir été le premier parti à Ottawa à avancer l'idée d'une loi antigang et en a fait l'un de ses principaux chevaux de bataille jusqu'à son adoption finale par le Parlement fédéral.
201105,62,62901,723,NA,NA,Les condamnations obtenues à l'issue du «mégaprocès» des Hells Angels en 2004 témoignent avec éloquence de l'utilité d'une telle loi.
201105,62,62901,724,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois est également fier d'avoir réussi à convaincre les autres partis politiques fédéraux de la nécessité d'imposer aux membres des organisations criminelles condamnés le devoir de justifier, par preuve prépondérante, la provenance de leurs biens."

201105,62,62901,726,NA,NA,"Aujourd'hui, ces lois permettent aux organismes qui sont responsables de leur application d'avoir recours à un ensemble d'outils législatifs et réglementaires pour poursuivre plus efficacement en justice les organisations ou les associations criminelles."
201105,62,62901,728,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois a été de tous les combats pour lutter contre le crime organisé et il a remporté plusieurs batailles, notamment l'adoption de la loi antigang et l'abolition des billets de 1000 dollars, qui facilitaient le blanchiment d'argent."
201105,62,62901,729,NA,NA,"Malgré les succès des récentes opérations policières, le crime organisé demeure une problématique importante, notamment parce qu'il nourrit la contrebande de produits illicites et s'infiltre dans plusieurs secteurs de l'économie."
201105,62,62901,730,NA,NA,Il doit donc être combattu avec acharnement.
201105,62,62901,732,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois suggère de rendre illégales les organisations criminelles comme les Hells Angels et autres groupes similaires.
201105,62,62901,733,NA,NA,"Il n'existe aucune raison permettant de justifier que ces regroupements, qui ont pour but l'enrichissement par des moyens criminels et qui, conséquemment, perturbent l'économie réelle, puissent bénéficier d'une existence légale."

201105,62,62901,735,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois estime que, tout comme un membre d'une organisation criminelle déclaré coupable doit démontrer que ses biens ne sont pas le fruit de son crime, les personnes déclarées coupables de vol d'automobile, de prêt usuraire, de vol qualifié, de fraude ou de vol de plus de 5000 dollars ainsi que de contrefaçon de monnaie devraient aussi faire cette démonstration."

201105,62,62901,740,NA,NA,la création d'un fonds permettant au Québec et aux provinces de former des procureurs de la Couronne spécialisés dans les procès liés aux gangs de rue.
201105,62,62901,741,NA,NA,"Cette proposition s'inspire de l'expérience du gouvernement du Québec, qui a créé le Bureau de lutte au crime organisé (BLACO) en 2001 avec des équipes de procureurs spécialisés en matière de crime organisé."
201105,62,62901,742,NA,NA,La création de procureurs spécialisés a permis au BLACO d'obtenir la condamnation de 286 personnes pour des accusations de gangstérisme ;
201105,62,62901,743,NA,NA,"puisque la technique du système de positionnement mondial (GPS) est utile aux policiers pour faire la preuve des déplacements des individus membres de gangs et pour les relier entre eux, le Bloc Québécois propose de prolonger les mandats obtenus pour les enquêtes effectuées au moyen de filature par GPS de manière à ce qu'ils aient la même durée que le mandat d'écoute électronique, soit un an."
201105,62,62901,745,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois a toujours adopté une approche équilibrée quant au système correctionnel en favorisant des mesures qui permettent de réhabiliter les criminels tout en maintenant à l'écart de la société les personnes qui mettent la sécurité des citoyens et citoyennes en danger.
201105,62,62901,746,NA,NA,"Or, en relâchant prématurément certains prisonniers, le système de libération conditionnelle tel qu'il existe aujourd'hui au Canada, a ceci de regrettable qu'il contrecarre l'évaluation faite par le juge lors de la détermination de la sentence et qu'il est de nature à déconsidérer l'administration de la justice auprès de la population, qui estime souvent que la majorité des peines ne sont pas assez sévères."
201105,62,62901,747,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois fait confiance aux juges et croit qu'ils sont les mieux placés pour déterminer les peines les plus appropriées.
201105,62,62901,748,NA,NA,"D'autres mécanismes permettant des libérations anticipées existent ; cependant, ces libérations doivent se faire à la pièce et non de façon quasi automatique."
201105,62,62901,749,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois demande l'abolition de la procédure d'examen expéditif (libération quasi automatique au sixième de la peine) afin que soit instauré un équilibre entre la crédibilité du système de justice, l'objectif de réhabilitation et la dénonciation du crime."
201105,62,62901,750,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois souhaite que le caractère quasi automatique de la libération d'office (aux deux tiers de la peine) soit remplacé par le principe de l'évaluation formelle des détenus par un professionnel quant au risque global de récidive qu'ils représentent pour la communauté.
201105,62,62901,752,NA,NA,"Au cours des dernières années, de nombreuses fraudes financières ont été révélées au grand jour."

201105,62,62901,757,NA,NA,l'abolition complète de la libération au sixième de la peine.
201105,62,62901,758,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois propose depuis juin 2007 l'abolition de cette mesure qui mine la crédibilité du système judiciaire.
201105,62,62901,759,NA,NA,"Une telle abolition permettrait donc de prolonger les peines d'emprisonnement pour les fraudeurs, même pour ceux qui sont déjà arrêtés et qui attendent leur procès criminel."

201105,62,62901,765,NA,NA,La création d'escouades multidisciplinaires qui intégreraient dans leurs rangs des spécialistes en comptabilité et des avocats permettrait à la fois de déceler rapidement les fraudes et de poursuivre plus fréquemment et plus rapidement les fraudeurs.
201105,62,62901,766,NA,NA,"Preuve de la pertinence de cette proposition, le 13 septembre 2009, le gouvernement du Québec a donné le feu vert à la formation d'une équipe mixte de lutte contre les fraudes financières."

201105,62,62901,801,NA,NA,"Pourtant, les conséquences pour certaines communautés sont importantes, notamment en ce qui a trait au commerce, au tourisme ou encore à la vie de tous les jours puisque la frontière traverse parfois des communautés entières."

201105,62,62901,811,NA,NA,Conséquemment le Bloc Québécois a refusé de cautionner ces lacunes sévères et s'est opposé à l'adoption du projet de loi C-3.

201105,62,62901,817,1,-1,"À l'heure actuelle, le droit d'appel est si limité qu'il n'en est pratiquement pas un."
201105,62,62901,819,1,0,"En vertu de l'entente Cullen-Couture conclue en 1978 et de l'accord Canada-Québec signé en 1991, le Québec est assuré d'une certaine autonomie en matière d'immigration, puisqu'il détient [a responsabilité exclusive de la sélection des immigrants indépendants - travailleurs et gens d'affaires - et de l'établissement des réfugiés qui désirent s'installer au Québec."
201105,62,62901,820,1,1,Le gouvernement fédéral continue cependant de s'occuper de la réunification familiale et des demandes d'asile.

201105,62,62901,825,2,1,"Or, depuis l'accord Canada-Québec de 1991. le Québec est le seul à s'occuper de l'intégration des immigrants et immigrantes sur son territoire."
201105,62,62901,826,2,1,"La réunification d'une famille étant un élément incontournable dans l'intégration des immigrantes et immigrants à la société québécoise, le Bloc Québécois estime que la réunification des familles doit être rapatriée à Québec, qui est déjà responsable de l'ensemble des questions relatives à la famille."
201105,62,62901,827,1,1,"Qui plus est, cette mesure permettrait un traitement plus efficace des demandes de réunification familiale ainsi que la concentration de la grande majorité des procédures au ministère de l'Immigration et des Communautés culturelles du Québec, tout en préservant le droit qu'a Ottawa de veiller aux considérations sécuritaires."
201105,62,62901,828,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement du Québec possède l'expertise pour ce faire et l'a d'ailleurs démontré en allant de l'avant avec sa propre grille de sélection pour réunifier les sinistrés d'origine haïtienne, dont 60 % de la communauté habite le Québec."
201105,62,62901,829,NA,NA,7.1.1 Le Bloc Québécois pressera le gouvernement fédéral d'entreprendre des négociations avec le gouvernement du Québec en vue de lui transférer la responsabilité de la réunification des familles.
201105,62,62901,830,NA,NA,"D'ici à ce que ce transfert soit effectué, le Bloc Québécois pressera le gouvernement fédéral de mettre tout en œuvre afin d'accélérer la réunification des familles."
201105,62,62901,832,1,1,"Le manque de leadership du gouvernement fédéral en matière d'immigration dans la foulée du tremblement de terre en Haïti de janvier 2010 est un exemple concret qui démontre pourquoi la responsabilité de la réunification familiale devrait incomber au Québec, qui a su mieux et plus rapidement adapter ses critères à la tragédie haïtienne."
201105,62,62901,833,NA,NA,"Dès le début de la tragédie, le gouvernement fédéral avait annoncé l'adoption de mesures spéciales afin d'accélérer le traitement des demandes de réunification familiale."
201105,62,62901,834,1,1,"Or, malgré tous les mécanismes mis en place depuis le séisme, force est de constater l'échec du gouvernement dans ce dossier, alors que les visas de résidents permanents ont été délivrés au compte-gouttes même si la situation devenait de plus en plus intenable et dangereuse en Haïti."
201105,62,62901,835,NA,NA,"Bien que le ministère se targue d'avoir approuvé des centaines de demandes, la réalité est que la bureaucratie reste lourde et lente et que les nouveaux résidents tardent à arriver au pays."
201105,62,62901,837,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois continuera de presser le gouvernement fédéral de faire preuve de plus de souplesse et de volonté afin d'autoriser plus rapidement et d'émettre sans délai inutile le visa d'entrée au pays pour les dossiers de parrainage prêts à être autorisés par Ottawa.
201105,62,62901,838,NA,NA,"Pour accueillir les sinistrées et sinistrés sélectionnés plus rapidement et afin d'alléger la bureaucratie, le Bloc Québécois demande au gouvernement de prévoir la mise sur pied d'un plan d'urgence qui permettra d'établir des directives en cas de catastrophe humanitaire."
201105,62,62901,840,1,0,Le gouvernement fédéral s'est longuement penché sur les questions touchant l'immigration et la citoyenneté au cours des dernières années.
201105,62,62901,841,1,-1,"Prenons-en pour exemple les objecteurs de conscience, les lacunes juridiques de la Loi canadienne sur la citoyenneté, l'encadrement des consultants en immigration et la réforme du système des demandeurs d'asile."
201105,62,62901,842,1,-1,"Or, nous observons à travers l'élaboration de ces politiques une tendance discriminatoire visant à fermer [es frontières, notamment à ceux et celles qui désirent obtenir le statut de réfugié."
201105,62,62901,843,1,0,"Pour preuve [a fourchette cible pour le nombre total de personnes protégées est passée de «26 000 à 31 800» en 2008, à «10 600 à 26 000» en 2010."
201105,62,62901,844,2,-1,"Sans oublier l'emploi grandissant d'une rhétorique de propagande qui, au nom de la sécurité, sert à justifier l'adoption d'une position plus dure envers cette catégorie d'immigrants et immigrantes."
201105,62,62901,845,1,1,"7.3.1 Si le Bloc Québécois voit d'un bon œil les efforts du gouvernement visant à mieux encadrer le système d'immigration, il veillera à ce que les mesures élaborées assurent un réel équilibre entre les impératifs de sécurité et le respect des droits des immigrants et des réfugiés afin qu'ils soient traités de façon juste et équitable."
201105,62,62901,847,1,0,"Entre 2005 à 2009, l'arriéré des demandes en instance à la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (CISR) est passé de 20 000 à plus de 60 000, un chiffre jamais atteint depuis la création de cet organisme il y a 20 ans."
201105,62,62901,848,NA,NA,"Pour 2010, les prévisions n'ont pas changé."
201105,62,62901,849,1,0,"Alors qu'ils vivent déjà dans une situation précaire, les demandeurs d'asile doivent parfois attendre jusqu'à plusieurs années avant d'obtenir leur statut de réfugié."
201105,62,62901,850,1,1,"Dans un tel contexte, une réforme du système apparaît plus que nécessaire."
201105,62,62901,851,NA,NA,"Toutefois, il est important de rappeler que le gouvernement fédéral est le premier responsable du retard qu'il a lui-même engendré :"
201105,62,62901,852,1,0,1.RETARD DANS LA NOMINATION DE COMMISSAIRES À L'IMMIGRATION Le problème majeur concerne les postes vacants des commissaires à l'immigration.
201105,62,62901,853,NA,NA,"En effet, le gouvernement fédéral a consi dérablement ralenti la nomination et le renouvellement des mandats des postes de commis saires, préférant ne pas renouveler le mandat de plusieurs commissaires nommés par le régime libéral."
201105,62,62901,854,1,0,"Ainsi, de 2006 à 2009, la CISR a été partiellement paralysée, fonctionnant avec des dizaines de décideurs en moins."
201105,62,62901,855,NA,NA,"Ce n'est qu'en mars 2010 que le gouvernement conservateur a nommé suffisamment de commissaires pour atteindre 99 % des effectifs visés, bien qu'il ait repris la bonne vieille pratique des libéraux de nommer les amis du parti aux postes de commissaires."
201105,62,62901,856,1,0,7.4.1 Le Bloc Québécois prônera la dépolitisation du mode de nomination des commissaires à l'immigration pour que ce soit fait par un comité indépendant se fondant principalement sur la compétence en immigration et sur la capacité d'exercer en français.
201105,62,62901,857,1,-1,"2.LA SECTION D'APPEL DES RÉFUGIÉS Le gouvernement fédéral a toujours retardé la mise en vigueur d'une véritable procédure d'appel pour les demandeurs du statut de réfugié comme le prévoit la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés, sanctionnée en novembre 2001."
201105,62,62901,858,1,1,"La Section d'appel des réfugiés (SAR) est pourtant une instance bien plus efficace pour traiter les demandeurs déboutés que ne peuvent l'être les autres recours existants, sans oublier que la SAR permet un traitement beaucoup plus équitable des demandes d'asile."
201105,62,62901,859,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois n'a cessé de réclamer du gouvernement fédéral qu'il respecte la loi adoptée en Chambre et implante enfin la SAR.
201105,62,62901,860,NA,NA,"En février 2009, le Bloc Québécois a d'ailleurs présenté pour une deuxième fois un projet de loi visant l'entrée en vigueur des articles concernés, mais le rejet de ce dernier a été hypocritement orchestré par les conservateurs et les libéraux."
201105,62,62901,862,1,1,"C'est dans le cadre du projet de loi C-11 sur la réforme du système d'octroi de l'asile, adopté en juin 2010, que le Bloc Québécois a réussi à faire implanter un droit d'appel accessible à tous les demandeurs d'asile, sans exception."
201105,62,62901,863,NA,NA,"Au départ, le gouvernement fédéral cherchait notamment à mettre sur pied un concept de pays désignés selon lequel les demandeuses et les demandeurs déboutés provenant de pays jugés «sûrs» n'auraient pas eu accès à la nouvelle SAR, mesure que le Bloc Québécois considérait extrêmement discriminatoire."
201105,62,62901,864,NA,NA,"Or, le gouvernement conservateur tenait mordicus à cette classification des pays et, dans le cas où cette mesure ne serait pas acceptée, il menaçait même de saborder son propre projet de loi."
201105,62,62901,865,1,1,"En se faisant le fervent défenseur des droits des réfugiés auprès du gouvernement et des autres partis, le Bloc Québécois a permis d'établir un compromis de dernière minute visant l'adoption d'une réforme véritablement efficace et, plus important encore, équitable pourtous les demandeurs d'asile."
201105,62,62901,866,NA,NA,"En effet, bien que le concept de pays désignés demeure, la SAR sera accessible à TOUS, y compris les demandeuses et les demandeurs originaires des pays désignés."
201105,62,62901,867,NA,NA,"Pour compenser, deux autres mécanismes d'accélération ont été mis en place :"
201105,62,62901,868,1,0,la Section de la protection des réfugiés pourra faire état dans sa décision du fait que la demande est manifestement infondée si elle est d'avis que celle-ci est clairement frauduleuse.
201105,62,62901,869,NA,NA,Les demandes déboutées qui seraient ensuite envoyées à la SAR seraient traitées de façon accélérée
201105,62,62901,870,1,1,les délais de traitement (qui seront énoncés par règlement) pour les demandeurs d'asile originaires d'un pays désigné seront plus courts que ceux pour les demandes régulières.

201105,62,62901,878,2,0,"Le problème de l'hémorragie des régions est toujours criant et, parallèlement, de nombreux immigrants peinent à se trouver un emploi dans les grandes villes. Au Québec, environ 80 % des immigrants s'établissent dans la région métropolitaine de Montréal."

201105,62,62901,883,2,0,"Or, le gouvernement fédéral, dans le cadre de ses activités, ne fait rien pour favoriser l'établissement des immigrantes et des immigrants en région"

201105,62,62901,933,NA,NA,Mais le gouvernement fédéral a fait fi de leurs demandes.
201105,62,62901,934,NA,NA,Il est clair que ce n'est pas en faisant preuve d'un désintéressement chronique envers tout ce qui concerne les peuples autochtones que le fédéral fera renaître l'espoir.
201105,62,62901,935,NA,NA,"Il faut dire les choses telles qu'elles sont : le gouvernement fédéral n'assume pas ses responsabilités de fiduciaire et705, par conséquent, des communautés autochtones vivent dans des conditions comparables à celles de nombreux pays en voie de développement."

201105,62,62901,941,NA,NA,Il y a eu aussi l'accord de Kelowna de 2005- Cet accord prévoyait un investissement de plus de 5 milliards de dollars échelonné sur cinq ans pour combler minimalement l'écart en matière de qualité de vie qui prévaut entre les peuples autochtones et les autres Canadiens.
201105,62,62901,942,NA,NA,"Bien que l'accord n'avait pas pour objectif premier de régler le fond du problème, il se présentait comme une mesure provisoire."
201105,62,62901,943,NA,NA,Le gouvernement conservateur l'a tout simplement mis sous le tapis.
201105,62,62901,944,NA,NA,"Enfin, depuis près de 15 ans, même si la population autochtone augmente de près de 7 % par année, le financement aux Premières Nations, pour sa part, n'augmente que de 2 % par année."

201105,62,62901,961,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois prévoit d'ailleurs que les dix nations autochtones et la nation inuite qui habitent le territoire québécois seront du nombre des peuples fondateurs du Québec souverain et qu'une association basée sur un rapport égalitaire s'avérera essentielle au développement du Québec tout entier.

201105,62,62901,974,NA,NA,La première préoccupation du Bloc Québécois est le sort des populations qui vivent en Arctique.
201105,62,62901,975,NA,NA,"Dans ce contexte, le gouvernement fédéral doit dès maintenant permettre au Nunavik d'avoir accès aux programmes de soutien socioéconomique pour l'Arctique, au même titre que les trois territoires canadiens, et transférer au Québec sa part des enveloppes budgétaires concernées afin que ce dernier puisse favoriser l'essor du Nord québécois en étroite collaboration avec les nuits qui y vivent."

201105,62,62901,1223,NA,NA,"Citons par exemple les ententes relatives aux Corporations de développement économique communautaire (CDEC), le programme Initiative en matière de logement abordable, les conventions d'exploitation des logements sociaux, etc. ;"
201105,62,62901,1224,NA,NA,qu'un vaste programme soit mis sur pied pour soutenir les entrepreneures et entrepreneurs qui sont en processus de démarrage d'entreprise.

201105,62,62901,1226,NA,NA,11.7.2Nous avons aussi proposé une série d'initiatives environnementales susceptibles de contribuer au développement d'entreprises d'économie sociale s'inscrivant dans une démarche de développement durable :
201105,62,62901,1227,NA,NA,"Un fonds de 750 millions de dollars dédié au développement des énergies vertes, notamment par l'entremise d'un programme écoÉNERGIE bonifié."
201105,62,62901,1228,NA,NA,"Ces initiatives pourront financer, par exemple, des projets visant l eolienne, la biomasse, le solaire et la géothermie ;"
201105,62,62901,1229,NA,NA,Un généreux crédit d'impôt pour les entreprises qui mettent en place des installations pour favoriser l'utilisation du vélo comme mode de transport alternatif.
201105,62,62901,1231,NA,NA,Il y a déséquilibre fiscal lorsqu'un niveau de gouvernement a des revenus excédant ce dont il a besoin pour assumer ses propres responsabilités alors que l'autre ne peut pas assumer les siennes par ses propres moyens.
201105,62,62901,1232,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement fédéral a créé le déséquilibre fiscal en coupant dans les transferts au Québec et aux provinces pour la santé, l'éducation et les programmes sociaux, et en se servant des surplus générés par ces coupes pour multiplier les intrusions dans les champs de compétences du Québec et des provinces."
201105,62,62901,1233,NA,NA,"Quoi qu'en disent les partis pancanadiens, le déséquilibre fiscal n'est pas réglé"
201105,62,62901,1234,NA,NA,. Le Québec n'est toujours pas à l'abri des décisions unilatérales du gouvernement fédéral qui tient le Québec en laisse par ses politiques en matière de transferts.
201105,62,62901,1235,NA,NA,"À preuve, le gouvernement fédéral annonce déjà que l'entente sur la santé subira un régime minceur lorsqu'elle viendra à échéance en 2014"
201105,62,62901,1236,NA,NA,Le règlement définitif du déséquilibre fiscal passe par le retrait du gouvernement fédéral des champs de compétences du Québec et le remplacement des transferts en espèces d'Ottawa par un espace fiscal équivalent.
201105,62,62901,1237,NA,NA,"Ainsi, le Québec redeviendra autonome dans les domaines où la Constitution prévoyait en 1867 qu'il le soit."
201105,62,62901,1238,NA,NA,"Malheureusement, les promesses conservatrices en matière d'ouverture n'étaient que de la poudre aux yeux."
201105,62,62901,1239,NA,NA,"Michael Ignatieff, de son côté, a dit clairement que la reconnaissance de la nation québécoise : «Ce n'est pas non plus le prélude à une nouvelle série de transferts de compétences.»"
201105,62,62901,1240,NA,NA,"En matière d'autonomie du Québec, Ignatieff et Harper, c'est du pareil au même."
201105,62,62901,1241,NA,NA,12.1.1 Le Bloc Québécois mettra tout en œuvre pour trouver une solution au déséquilibre fiscal afin que la nation québécoise retrouve l'autonomie financière dont elle a besoin pour mieux maîtriser le développement de la société québécoise.
201105,62,62901,1242,NA,NA,"À cette fin, le Bloc Québécois demandera, lors de toutes les occasions qui s'offrent à lui, le rapatriement de points d'impôt vers le gouvernement du Québec."
201105,62,62901,1244,NA,NA,Soyons clairs : le pouvoir de dépenser du gouvernement fédéral doit se limiter aux domaines qui relèvent de sa juridiction.
201105,62,62901,1245,NA,NA,Un point c'est tout.
201105,62,62901,1246,NA,NA,Ses dépenses dans des domaines qui relèvent des compétences du Québec sont des ingérences qui remettent en cause le partage des pouvoirs entre les deux niveaux de gouvernement.
201105,62,62901,1247,NA,NA,"En 1867, les Québécoises et les Québécois s'étaient fait promettre qu'ils seraient souverains dans plusieurs domaines et qu'ils pourraient utiliser cette souveraineté partielle pour développer eux-mêmes leur société."
201105,62,62901,1248,NA,NA,C'est d'ailleurs ce que laissait entendre l'emploi du mot «confédération» plutôt que «fédération».
201105,62,62901,1249,NA,NA,C'est à cette condition que le Québec a adhéré au Canada.
201105,62,62901,1250,NA,NA,"Ottawa n'hésite pas à envahir les champs de compétences exclusifs du Québec : la politique familiale, la santé et l'éducation ou encore le développement régional sont quelques-uns des exemples les plus frappants de l'ingérence du fédéral."
201105,62,62901,1251,NA,NA,"En 2008-2009, Le gouvernement fédéral a dépensé plus de 60 milliards de dollars dans des domaines qui relèvent du Québec et des provinces."
201105,62,62901,1252,NA,NA,Cette situation est clairement intolérable.
201105,62,62901,1253,NA,NA,C'est pourquoi le Bloc Québécois a déposé en avril 2010 un projet de loi visant l'élimination du prétendu pouvoir fédéral de dépenser dans les champs de compétences du Québec.
201105,62,62901,1254,NA,NA,Ce projet de loi s'articule autour de trois principes : l'abolition explicite du droit que s'est arrogé Ottawa de dépenser dans les domaines qui ne relèvent pas de ses compétences
201105,62,62901,1255,NA,NA,", un droit de retrait systématique pour le Québec, inconditionnel et avec pleine compensation"
201105,62,62901,1256,NA,NA,", ainsi qu'une compensation prenant la forme de points d'impôt afin d'éviter qu'Ottawa ne détermine les montants que le Québec consacre à ses différentes responsabilités."
201105,62,62901,1257,NA,NA,"12.2.1 Pour que les Québécoises et les Québécois redeviennent souverains dans les domaines où la Constitution prévoit qu'ils le sont, le Bloc Québécois entend tout faire pour que soit adopté son projet de loi limitant les dépenses fédérales aux seuls champs de compétence fédérale."
201105,62,62901,1259,NA,NA,"Sous Jean Chrétien et Paul Martin, les libéraux ont imposé des modifications unilatérales à la formule de péréquation qui ont fait perdre des milliards de dollars au Québec."
201105,62,62901,1260,NA,NA,"Les conservateurs, en 2007, ont tout d'abord montré une certaine ouverture en modifiant la formule de péréquation pour rétablir en partie l'injustice libérale."
201105,62,62901,1261,NA,NA,"Mis à part les revenus provenant du pétrole qu'Ottawa ne comptabilisait qu'à moitié, le reste de la formule répondait à une certaine logique."
201105,62,62901,1262,NA,NA,"Cependant, dès le dépôt du budget libéral-conservateur de 2006, Ottawa n'a pas tardé à reprendre la vieille méthode libérale et à imposer un plafonnement à la formule de péréquation qui fait perdre des milliards au Québec, année après année, bafouant ainsi une motion unanime de l'Assemblée nationale en janvier 200Ç."
201105,62,62901,1263,NA,NA,Le plafonnement de la péréquation permet au gouvernement fédéral de détourner les revenus provenant de la richesse albertaine pour ses propres priorités au lieu de permettre au Québec et aux provinces d'offrir des services à la population.
201105,62,62901,1264,NA,NA,"En matière de péréquation et de respect de la volonté du Québec, les libéraux et les conservateurs, c'est du pareil au même."
201105,62,62901,1265,NA,NA,"Bien que l'on fasse miroiter les bienfaits économiques de l'exploitation des sables bitumineux sur l'ensemble des provinces, il ne s'agit en réalité que d'un leurre pour le Québec."
201105,62,62901,1266,NA,NA,"En fait, il est plus juste de dire que le développement des sables bitumineux et l'augmentation des exportations de pétrole aux États-Unis nuisent à l'économie du Québec, notamment en poussant à la hausse le dollar canadien."
201105,62,62901,1267,NA,NA,"Cela a pour effet de ralentir les exportations québécoises, lesquelles proviennent majoritairement du secteur manufacturier, sans pour autant faire gonfler les paiements de péréquation."
201105,62,62901,1268,NA,NA,"12.3.1 Le Bloc Québécois s'engage à presser le gouvernement fédéral afin qu'il établisse une formule de calcul de la péréquation non plafonnée, fondée sur la norme des dix provinces et qui tient compte de l'ensemble des revenus du Québec et des provinces."
201105,62,62901,1270,NA,NA,"Par la porte arrière, le ministre des Finances, Jim Flaherty, a modifié la manière dont étaient calculés les revenus des sociétés productrices d'hydroélectricité afin de permettre à l'Ontario de profiter de transferts plus élevés en matière de péréquation."
201105,62,62901,1271,NA,NA,"Fidèle à son habitude du «tout à l'Ontario et rien au Québec», le ministre des Finances a refusé que le Québec ait droit au même traitement, privant ainsi le gouvernement du Québec de 250 millions de dollars annuellement."
201105,62,62901,1272,NA,NA,"Les libéraux, comme les conservateurs, ont choisi leur camp en votant contre une motion du Bloc Québécois, en février 2009, qui réclamait que le Québec soit traité équitablement en matière de revenus hydroélectriques."
201105,62,62901,1273,NA,NA,"Par ailleurs, il faut savoir qu'en raison de la bonne tenue relative de son économie, le gouvernement du Québec verra ses paiements de péréquation réduits de 664 millions de dollars au cours de 2011-2012."
201105,62,62901,1274,NA,NA,"Contrairement aux provinces canadiennes, le Québec ne bénéficiera pas de paiements de protection en guise d'indemnisation pour cette baisse des transferts."
201105,62,62901,1275,NA,NA,Le gouvernement du Québec estime que l'usage systématique de ces «paiements de protection» rapporterait jusqu'à 250 millions supplémentaires au Québec annuellement.
201105,62,62901,1277,NA,NA,12.3.2 Le Bloc Québécois s'engage à presser le gouvernement fédéral afin qu'il accorde au Québec le même traitement qu'à l'Ontario en matière de ressources hydroélectriques et qu'il consente aux demandes du gouvernement du Québec concernant l'usage systématique des paiements de protection.
201105,62,62901,1279,NA,NA,Le gouvernement Harper a déposé le 26 mai 2010 à la Chambre des communes un avant-projet de loi visant la création d'une commission pancanadienne des valeurs mobilières.
201105,62,62901,1280,NA,NA,La réglementation des valeurs mobilières est une compétence constitutionnelle exclusive du Québec et des provinces.
201105,62,62901,1281,NA,NA,Le projet fédéral de commission pancanadienne méprise les responsabilités québécoises en matière de propriété et de droits civils.
201105,62,62901,1282,NA,NA,"Néanmoins, dès leur arrivée au pouvoir, les conservateurs ont repris le vieux rêve libéral de créer une seule commission des valeurs mobilières afin d'évincer le Québec du monde de la finance."
201105,62,62901,1283,NA,NA,"Loin de s'y opposer, Michael Ignatieff a appuyé le budget conservateur qui jetait les bases du transfert des pouvoirs qui sont constitutionnellement dévolus au Québec."
201105,62,62901,1284,NA,NA,"Ainsi conservateurs et libéraux ont bafoué non pas une, mais deux motions unanimes de l'Assemblée nationale du Québec qui réclamaient le respect de ses compétences en matière de réglementation des valeurs mobilières."
201105,62,62901,1285,NA,NA,Micha el Ignat i eff est à peine plu s nuancé que Stephen Harper sur cette question.
201105,62,62901,1286,NA,NA,"Il appuie l'idée d'évincer le Québec du monde de la finance, mais précise qu'un gouvernement libéral aurait relégué cette question à la Cour suprême du Canada avant d'agir."
201105,62,62901,1287,NA,NA,"Or, la Cour suprême, dont tous les membres sont nommés par Ottawa, est comme la tour de Pise : elle penche toujours du même côté lors des conflits de juridiction."
201105,62,62901,1288,NA,NA,"12.4.1 Le Bloc Québécois fera tout en son pouvoir pour contrer le projet libéral repris par les conservateurs de créer une commission pancanadienne des valeurs mobilières, afin que le Québec conserve ses pouvoirs en matière de réglementation financière."
201105,62,62901,1290,NA,NA,"Dès 1991, le Québec a harmonisé, de son propre chef et sans aide du fédéral, sa taxe de vente avec la taxe sur les produits et services (TPS)."
201105,62,62901,1291,NA,NA,"Six ans plus tard, le gouvernement libéral offrait 1 milliard de dollars aux provinces maritimes ayant harmonisé leur taxe de vente."
201105,62,62901,1292,NA,NA,"Outré de l'attitude injuste du gouvernement libéral qui indemnisait les Maritimes et non le Québec, le gouvernement du Québec a entamé une bataille avec le fédéral afin d'avoir droit au même traitement."
201105,62,62901,1293,NA,NA,Cette demande a été rejetée du revers de la main.
201105,62,62901,1294,NA,NA,"En mars 2010, le ministre fédéral des Finances a à nouveau opposé un refus aux demandes du Québec concernant les quelque 2,2 milliards de dollars qui lui sont dus depuis le début des années 1990 pour l'harmonisation de sa taxe avec la taxe fédérale."
201105,62,62901,1295,NA,NA,"Avant même la rentrée parlementaire 2011, le gouvernement fédéral a annoncé qu'il n'était pas question d'un règlement dans le budget 2011, et ce, malgré les efforts concertés de l'Assemblée nationale et du Bloc Québécois pour obtenir une juste indemnisation pour le Québec."
201105,62,62901,1296,NA,NA,Le ministre Flaherty justifie son refus en prétextant que l'harmonisation des taxes n'est pas complète au Québec.
201105,62,62901,1297,NA,NA,"Or, le ministre a modifié les règles pour en venir à une entente avec l'Ontario, à qui il a consenti une généreuse compensation de l'ordre de 4,3 milliards de dollars."
201105,62,62901,1298,NA,NA,"L'Assemblée nationale a approuvé à l'unanimité, le 30 mars 2009, une motion dénonçant le refus du gouvernement fédéral d'offrir au Québec une compensation comparable à celles obtenues par la Colombie-Britannique et l'Ontario en 2009 pour l'harmonisation de leurtaxe de vente avec la taxe sur les produits et services."
201105,62,62901,1299,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois travaille d'arrache-pied pour faire valoir les revendications de l'Assemblée nationale, qui déplore que le gouvernement fédéral refuse toujours de traiter les Québécoises et les Québécois avec équité."
201105,62,62901,1300,NA,NA,"12.5.1 Le Bloc Québécois s'engage à faire pression sur le gouvernement fédéral afin qu'il négocie une entente avec le Québec, dans l'esprit de la motion unanime de l'Assemblée nationale, pour que le Québec soit équitablement indemnisé à hauteur de 2,2 milliards de dollars pour l'harmonisation de sa taxe de vente."
201105,62,62901,1302,NA,NA,L'indemnisation pour l'harmonisation de la taxe de vente et les litiges relatifs à la péréquation ne sont pas les seuls dossiers dans lesquels le Québec est tributaire des décisions du gouvernement Harper.
201105,62,62901,1303,NA,NA,"Celui-ci doit cesser de faire preuve de mauvaise foi et s'engager davantage dans ses négociations avec Québec en ce qui concerne leurs nombreux contentieux, notamment :"
201105,62,62901,1304,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois porte le consensus québécois qui réclame que le gouvernement fédéral rétablisse ses transferts en matière de programmes sociaux et d'éducation au niveau d'avant les coupes de 1994-1995.
201105,62,62901,1305,NA,NA,"En vertu du programme de stabilisation des revenus, les provinces obtiennent des indemnisations si elles subissent des pertes de revenus."
201105,62,62901,1306,NA,NA,"Selon le gouvernement du Québec, le programme lui donnait droit à une indemnisation de 137 millions de dollars pour l'année financière 1991-1992."
201105,62,62901,1307,NA,NA,"Bien qu'un jugement déclaratoire ait donné raison au Québec, nous n'avons toujours pas vu la couleur de cet argent."
201105,62,62901,1308,NA,NA,"Le litige avec Ottawa concernant la crise du verglas dure depuis 11 ans, et ce sont 4-21 millions de dollars qui sont en cause."
201105,62,62901,1309,NA,NA,12.6.1 Le Bloc Québécois exige aujourd'hui un changement de cap radical pour ce qui concerne une série de contentieux entre Québec et Ottawa qui ne sont toujours pas réglés et qui s'élèvent en tout à 5 milliards de dollars.
201105,62,62901,1311,NA,NA,"Depuis 1991, le gouvernement du Québec perçoit la taxe sur les produits et services pour le compte du gouvernement fédéral, lequel le dédommage pour ce service."
201105,62,62901,1312,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois estime que le Québec devrait aussi percevoir la totalité de l'impôt sur le revenu.
201105,62,62901,1313,NA,NA,"Non seulement les entreprises et les particuliers pourraient économiser d'importantes sommes année après année, mais la réduction des coûts administratifs permettrait des économies récurrentes qu réduiraient la pression sur les finances publiques."
201105,62,62901,1314,NA,NA,"En effet, en maintenant deux structures distinctes pour l'administration des impôts, les Québécoises et les Québécois assument des coûts administratifs très élevés."
201105,62,62901,1315,NA,NA,La mise en place d'un rapport d'impôt unique par le gouvernement du Québec permettrait d'économiser des centaines de millions de dollars en coûts de chevauchement.
201105,62,62901,1316,NA,NA,"En outre, le passage à un rapport d'impôt unique serait très avantageux pour les entreprises qui doivent débourser d'importantes sommes afin de se conformer aux différentes exigences des deux rapports d'impôt."
201105,62,62901,1317,NA,NA,Ces coûts administratifs réduisent la compétitivité des entreprises.
201105,62,62901,1318,NA,NA,"Finalement, la production d'un seul rapport d'impôt par les contribuables québécois leur permettrait d'économiser des frais d'administration substantiels, tout en leur simplifiant la tâche."
201105,62,62901,1319,NA,NA,La mise en place du rapport d'impôt unique permettrait donc de mettre fin aux coûteux chevauchements et aux incohérences actuelles.
201105,62,62901,1320,NA,NA,"12.7.1 Le Bloc Québécois demandera au gouvernement fédéral d'entreprendre des pourparlers avec le gouvernement du Québec pour élaborer un rapport d'impôt unique à percevoir par le Québec, sur la base d'une entente du même type que celle de la TPS, pour la totalité des impôts sur le revenu sur le territoire du Québec."
201105,62,62901,1322,NA,NA,"Les compressions libérales du milieu des années 1990 dans les transferts fédéraux en éducation ont fait un tort considérable au gouvernement du Québec, qui a dû amputer ses budgets afin d'éviter de plonger dans un déficit chronique."
201105,62,62901,1323,NA,NA,"Encore aujourd'hui, la population québécoise subit les conséquences des coupes fédérales."
201105,62,62901,1324,NA,NA,"De son côté, le gouvernement fédéral refuse d'accéder à la demande du gouvernement du Québec qui réclame que les transferts soient rétablis à leur niveau indexé des années 1990."
201105,62,62901,1325,NA,NA,"Selon le gouvernement du Québec, le sous-investissement fédéral en matière d'éducation postsecondaire et en programmes sociaux atteint plus de 800 millions de dollars par an."

201105,62,62901,1327,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois continuera d'exiger que le gouvernement fédéral exempte d'impôt les bourses aux étudiants et étudiantes qui font des études postdoctorales afin de ne pas imposer une taxe au savoir.
201105,62,62901,1328,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois continuera de protéger le choix politique que le Québec a fait de développer sa propre politique d'enseignement universitaire et de frais de scolarité et
201105,62,62901,1329,NA,NA,exigera que le gouvernement fédéral transfère au gouvernement du Québec les sommes qu'il économise sur le dos des étudiantes et étudiants québécois grâce aux crédits fédéraux sur les frais de scolarité.
201105,62,62901,1331,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois a toujours prôné une gestion des finances publiques rigoureuse et responsable de façon à ne pas plonger le gouvernement fédéral dans des déficits récurrents.
201105,62,62901,1332,NA,NA,Les mesures qu'il propose peuvent être financées à long terme sans pour autant entraîner de compressions dans les transferts aux provinces et sans augmenter les impôts et les taxes de la classe moyenne.
201105,62,62901,1333,NA,NA,"Dans le cadre d'un plan budgétaire fiscalement responsable, le Bloc Québécois préconise la mise en place d'initiatives bénéfiques pour le Québec."
201105,62,62901,1334,NA,NA,"S'il est vrai que les mesures réclamées par le Bloc Québécois auraient comme effet d'augmenter légèrement le déficit au cours de l'exercice financier2011-2012l le Bloc Québécois compte rééquilibrer, à terme, les finances publiques afin d'éviter les déficits chroniques et récurrents."
201105,62,62901,1335,NA,NA,"En effet, le cadre financier élaboré par le Bloc Québécois prévoit, au cours des exercices financiers 2012-2013, 2013-2014 et 2014-2015, un déficit inférieur à celui qui est prévu par le gouvernement Harper."
201105,62,62901,1336,NA,NA,"Ainsi, notre plan aurait comme avantage d'accélérer le retour à l'équilibre budgétaire."
201105,62,62901,1337,NA,NA,"De plus, l'approche préconisée par le Bloc Québécois n'entraînera pas de compressions dans les transferts aux provinces ni d'augmentation de taxes et d'impôt pour la population et les entreprises - exception faite des entreprises pétrolières, dont on abolirait les cadeaux fiscaux, et de celles qui profitent des paradis fiscaux, dont on abolirait les échappatoires."
201105,62,62901,1338,NA,NA,Seuls les contribuables les mieux nantis ainsi que les dirigeants qui bénéficient de primes élevées verront leurs mpôts augmenter.
201105,62,62901,1339,NA,NA,"13.1.1 Le Bloc Québécois préconisera une approche pragmatique en matière de gestion des finances publiques qui permettra, à terme, d'atteindre l'équilibre budgétaire."
201105,62,62901,1340,NA,NA,Cette approche n'entraînera pas de compressions dans les transferts aux provinces ni d'augmentation de taxes et d'impôt pour la classe moyenne et les entreprises - exception faite des entreprises pétrolières et de celles qui profitent des paradis fiscaux.
201105,62,62901,1342,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement conservateur, appuyé par les libéraux, a mis de l'avant dans les budgets 2009 et 2010 des mesures qui, en facilitant le recours aux paradis fiscaux, limitent la capacité du gouvernement fédéral de faire payer des impôts aux banques et aux grandes entreprises."
201105,62,62901,1343,NA,NA,"Par exemple, il a ouvert des brèches dans la Loi de l'impôt sur le revenu pour permettre aux entreprises non enregistrées au Canada de ne pas payer leur juste part d'impôt."
201105,62,62901,1344,NA,NA,"Par ailleurs, le gouvernement conservateur dit vouloir s'attaquer aux paradis fiscaux, mais signe des conventions fiscales avec ces mêmes paradis fiscaux!"
201105,62,62901,1345,NA,NA,"L'Accord de libre-échange avec le Panama, un pays qui apparaît sur la liste grise de l'OCDE, permettra aux entreprises canadiennes y ayant des activités de rapatrier leurs bénéfices en franchise d'impôt."
201105,62,62901,1346,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois a voté contre cet accord à toutes les étapes de son cheminement.
201105,62,62901,1347,NA,NA,"Pour lutter contre l'évasion fiscale, le Bloc Québécois demande au gouvernement d'agir sur de nombreux fronts."

201105,62,62901,1349,NA,NA,Il doit également s'assurer de ne pas octroyer de bénéfices indus aux entreprises en leur permettant de rapatrier leurs revenus sans payer d'impôts au Canada.

201105,62,62901,1492,NA,NA,"La nécessaire préservation de nos ressources halieutiques et des mammifères marins est primordiale pour l'industrie des pêches et le développement récréotouristique, mais elle est aussi intimement liée à la qualité et au niveau de l'eau."
201105,62,62901,1493,NA,NA,La dernière tournée du Saint-Laurent entreprise par le Bloc Québécois à l'automne 2010 démontre une grande inquiétude des citoyens et citoyennes quant aux impacts des projets d'exploration et d'exploitation gazières et pétrolières en territoire maritime sur la qualité des eaux et quant aux autres impacts des changements climatiques sur le niveau de ces mêmes eaux.
201105,62,62901,1494,NA,NA,"15.1.1 Le Bloc Québécois demande que le gouvernement fédéral se range derrière le consensus québécois, adopte l'esprit de la gestion intégrée et reconnaisse la nécessité de développer une vision d'ensemble qui puisse mènera un arbitrage équitable des différentes vocations du Saint-Laurent, tout en protégeant l'ensemble de ses écosystèmes."
201105,62,62901,1496,NA,NA,Les tournées fluviales entreprises par le Bloc Québécois en 2005 et 2010 démontrent que l'érosion des berges est un problème qui touche l'ensemble des écosystèmes du Saint-Laurent et de ses tributaires.
201105,62,62901,1497,NA,NA,"Même si ce phénomène est à priori naturel, les dérèglements climatiques et la circulation maritime l'accélèrent de manière très importante, au point où plusieurs municipalités riveraines du Saint-Laurent voient leurs propriétés et infrastructures être sérieusement menacées."
201105,62,62901,1498,NA,NA,Le choix des solutions appropriées doit évaluer l'incidence des aménagements sur les portions en amont et en aval d'un cours d'eau.
201105,62,62901,1499,NA,NA,"Il n'est pas normal que le gouvernement fédéral, qui ne s'investit pas dans la lutte contre les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, laisse supporter l'énorme fardeau financier des conséquences de l'érosion des berges au Québec et aux provinces."
201105,62,62901,1500,NA,NA,Surtout que le Québec présente le meilleur bilan en matière de GES de tout le Canada !
201105,62,62901,1501,NA,NA,"15.1.2 Le Bloc Québécois demande la création d'un fonds de compensation dans un contexte de pérennité qui permettrait, d'une part, de dédommager le Québec et les provinces pour les frais déjà encourus pour lutter contre l'intensification de l'érosion due aux dérèglements climatiques et à la vitesse des navires et, d'autre part, de créer un programme de stabilisation des berges."
201105,62,62901,1503,NA,NA,La demande pourun meilleur accès au fleuve est très forte dans la population.
201105,62,62901,1504,NA,NA,"Très peu de sites sont accessibles au public, tout particulièrement en zone urbaine."
201105,62,62901,1505,NA,NA,"L'engouement des citadins pour les propriétés en bordure du fleuve, conjugué à la rareté des terrains disponibles, engendre une spéculation importante pour leur acquisition."
201105,62,62901,1506,NA,NA,L'accès au fleuve peut s'avérer un puissant moteur économique ainsi qu'un incitatif pour améliorer la qualité de l'eau.
201105,62,62901,1507,NA,NA,La tournée du Saint-Laurent 2010 a démontré la demande pressante d'infrastructures visant l'accès aussi bien d'embarcations privées que de navires de croisières.
201105,62,62901,1508,NA,NA,"À l'heure actuelle, le développement de nouveaux accès au fleuve se déroule au cas par cas dans un climat d'improvisation, et ce, malgré le travail sous-financé des comités de Zones d'intervention prioritaire (ZIP)."
201105,62,62901,1509,NA,NA,15.2.1 Le Bloc Québécois estime que les comités de Zones d'intervention prioritaire devraient recevoir la pleine reconnaissance pour leurs activités au sein des communautés et des écosystèmes qu'elles couvrent.
201105,62,62901,1510,NA,NA,"Afin de leur permettre de remplir le mandat qui leur est imparti, le Bloc Québécois demande que les comités ZIP se voient octroyer un financement conséquent."
201105,62,62901,1512,NA,NA,Le Saint-Laurent a toujours été un atout majeur pour le développement économique du Québec et de toutes ses régions.
201105,62,62901,1513,NA,NA,La position stratégique des industries par rapport au fleuve Saint-Laurent permet d'utiliser ce dernier pour la presque totalité des échanges commerciaux nternationaux en dehors des États-Unis.
201105,62,62901,1514,NA,NA,"Toutefois, cette voie navigable est sous-utilisée, comparativement à d'autres grands fleuves."
201105,62,62901,1515,NA,NA,"Cela s'explique par divers facteurs, notamment par un manque de compétitivité qui découle entre autres, des nombreuxfrais d'administration imposés aux utilisateurs (aide à la navigation services de communication maritime, dragage et déglaçage)."
201105,62,62901,1516,NA,NA,"En effet, ces services font l'objet d'une politique de recouvrement des coûts et sont payés en grande partie par l'industrie."
201105,62,62901,1518,NA,NA,"Le cas du forage pétrolier dans le golfe du Saint-Laurent montre encore une fois que le fédéralisme canadien ne répond pas aux intérêts et aux aspirations du Québec, surtout en matière d'environnement."
201105,62,62901,1519,NA,NA,"Pire, au sein du Canada, le Québec est régulièrement déclassé devant les provinces."
201105,62,62901,1520,NA,NA,"En effet, malgré de nombreuses demandes qui sont demeurées lettre morte, Ottawa a longtemps refusé et tarde toujours à conclure une entente permettant au Québec d'envisager librement la possibilité de mettre en valeur les ressources en hydrocarbures du golfe du Saint-Laurent."
201105,62,62901,1521,NA,NA,"Pourtant, dans les années 1980, le gouvernement fédéral a signé des accords avec Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador et la Nouvelle-Ecosse, les accords atlantiques, pour leur permettre d'exploiter leurs ressources pétrolières extracôtières."
201105,62,62901,1522,NA,NA,"A la suite de l'explosion de la plateforme Deepwater Horizon dans le golfe du Mexique et de l'important déversement de pétrole subséquent, l'attention s'est tournée vers les règles entourant le forage dans le golfe du Saint-Laurent."
201105,62,62901,1523,NA,NA,"Alors que Québec a imposé, jusqu'en 2012, un moratoire sur l'exploration et l'exploitation des hydrocarbures, une entreprise néo-écossaise entend commencer les travaux dans la partie terre-neuvienne de la formation géologique Old Harry le plus rapidement possible."
201105,62,62901,1524,NA,NA,Le Québec risque donc de partager le fardeau d'une catastrophe alors qu'il ne peut même pas considérer librement la possibilité de mettre en valeur cette ressource.
201105,62,62901,1525,NA,NA,La seule véritable solution aux questions se rapportant à l'exploitation et à la gestion du Saint-Laurent et de l'ensemble des ressources naturelles du Québec est celle de la souveraineté.
201105,62,62901,1526,NA,NA,Un Québec souverain se donne la possibilité d'éviter un tel musellement et s'approprie les seuls outils concrets lui permettant d'exprimer pleinement les choix écologiques et économiques qui correspondent aux aspirations et aux valeurs des Québécoises et des Québécois.
201105,62,62901,1527,NA,NA,"Un Québec souverain pourra enfin négocier d'égal à égal avec le Canada, protéger les écosystèmes du Saint-Laurent et faire entendre sa voix pour enfin faire respecter les choix distincts qu'il prend en la matière."
201105,62,62901,1529,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois exige que le gouvernement fédéral signe rapidement une entente avec le Québec - comme il l'a fait il y a longtemps pour Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador et la Nouvelle-Ecosse - lui permettant de décider librement de mettre en valeur ses ressources naturelles.
201105,62,62901,1530,NA,NA,"De plus, le Bloc Québécois continue de demander au gouvernement fédéral qu'il joigne sa voix à celle du gouvernement du Québec, qui a demandé à Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador d'instituer un moratoire sur l'exploitation des hydrocarbures dans le golfe du Saint-Laurent tant qu'un examen de toutes les mesures permettant d'éviter un désastre semblable à celui survenu dans le golfe du Mexique n'aura pas été complété."
201105,62,62901,1531,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois estime que tout projet énergétique ne devrait être autorisé qu'à deux conditions : qu'il ait au préalable obtenu le feu vert sur le plan des impacts environnementaux et qu'il améliore le bilan énergétique du Québec.
201105,62,62901,1533,NA,NA,"En raison de l'engorgement du réseau routier, le transport intermodal, notamment par ['utilisation accrue de conteneurs aux dimensions uniformisées, est une solution permettant d'acheminer rapidement des marchandises."
201105,62,62901,1534,NA,NA,"Non seulement les liaisons entre les réseaux routier, maritime et ferroviaire contribuent à la souplesse et à la rapidité de l'ensemble du réseau de transport, mais elles permettent également des gains significatifs en termes d'efficacité énergétique et de diminution des émissions de GES."
201105,62,62901,1535,NA,NA,"Actuellement, seulement le quart des navires circulant sur le fleuve font du cabotage, c'est-à-dire du transport maritime de courte distance."
201105,62,62901,1536,NA,NA,"Lors de la tournée du Saint-Laurent 2010, les ntervenants du domaine ont confirmé le potentiel de développement de ce type de transport."
201105,62,62901,1537,NA,NA,"Cette solution permettrait également de mettre à contribution certaines installations portuaires en région et aussi, selon les cas, de maximiser l'utilisation du réseau ferroviaire, dont certains tronçons sont sous-utilisés."
201105,62,62901,1538,NA,NA,C'est largement de cette façon que pourra se développer le corridor de commerce Saint-Laurent-Grands Lacs et que celui-ci pourra devenir véritablement la porte d'entrée des marchandises en provenance de l'Atlantique.
201105,62,62901,1540,NA,NA,a) de soutenir l'industrie du transport maritime en assumant la totalité des frais de dragage et de déglaçage et en révisant à la baisse les tarifs portuaires;

201105,62,62901,1545,NA,NA,fj d'effectuer adéquatement  l'entretien  de ses  propres  infrastructures  portuaires et  de favoriser leur développement.
201105,62,62901,1547,NA,NA,De nombreuses décisions qui concernent directement le Saint-Laurent échappent totalement au contrôle québécois.
201105,62,62901,1548,NA,NA,C'est notamment le cas pour de nombreux enjeux environnementaux soulevés devant la Commission mixte internationale (CMI).
201105,62,62901,1549,NA,NA,Cette Commission a pour mission de soutenir les gouvernements du Canada et des États-Unis dans la recherche de solutions face aux problèmes concernant les eaux limitrophes des deux pays.
201105,62,62901,1550,NA,NA,"Malgré le fait que le Saint-Laurent soit directement touché par les décisions concernant la qualité et le niveau de l'eau des Grands Lacs, le Québec ne peut faire valoir ses intérêts à titre de membre de la Commission."
201105,62,62901,1551,NA,NA,"À la discrétion du Canada, il est, tout au plus, invité à titre consultatif sur certains enjeux."
201105,62,62901,1552,NA,NA,"Devant cette attitude, la seule véritable solution est celle de la souveraineté."
201105,62,62901,1553,NA,NA,"En travaillant pour la souveraineté, le Bloc Québécois entend permettre au Québec de négocier d'égal à égal avec ses partenaires et de faire entendre sa voix pour enfin faire respecter les choix distincts qu'il prend en la matière."
201105,62,62901,1554,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois dénonce l'attitude du fédéral qui refuse encore une fois au Québec d'exprimer pleinement ses intérêts et compétences dans les dossiers d'intérêt national et de s'approprier [es seuls outils concrets lui permettant d'exprimer pleinement les choix écologiques et économiques qui correspondent aux aspirations et aux valeurs des Québécoises et des Québécois.
201105,62,62901,1555,NA,NA,"15.4.1 Le Bloc Québécois fera pression sur le gouvernement fédéral afin de s'assurer que la voix du Québec soit entendue chaque fois que des décisions prises sur la scène internationale toucheront de près ou de loin la mise en valeur, le développement et la protection des écosystèmes du Saint-Laurent."
201105,62,62901,1557,NA,NA,La nation québécoise habite un vaste territoire de plus d'un million de kilomètres carrés.
201105,62,62901,1558,NA,NA,Ce territoire que nous habitons fait partie de ce que nous sommes.
201105,62,62901,1559,NA,NA,"Pour que notre nation continue d'occuper pleinement et harmonieusement son territoire, il est indispensable que celles et ceux qui décident d'y vivre puissent y vivre bien."
201105,62,62901,1560,NA,NA,"Même si le développement régional et l'aménagement du territoire relèvent au premier chef du gouvernement du Québec, le gouvernement fédéral intervient dans une foule de domaines qui ont un impact sur le territoire et sur la qualité de vie en région."
201105,62,62901,1561,NA,NA,Une véritable politique québécoise du territoire ne sera possible que lorsque le Québec aura rapatrié ces pouvoirs et ces ressources actuellement détenus par Ottawa.
201105,62,62901,1562,NA,NA,Nous n'y parviendrons qu'en devenant un pays souverain.
201105,62,62901,1563,NA,NA,"D'ici là, les députées et députés du Bloc Québécois verront à ce que les interventions fédérales qui ont une incidence sur les régions du Québec puissent contribuer à leur vitalité et leur développement."
201105,62,62901,1564,NA,NA,"C'est tout un défi, d'autant plus qu'à Ottawa, les régions du Québec n'existent pas puisque le Québec lui-même n'est qu'une région."
201105,62,62901,1565,NA,NA,"Pour se développer, nos régions ont besoin d'infrastructures de qualité et de réseaux de transport efficaces."
201105,62,62901,1566,NA,NA,Elles ont besoin que le gouvernement du Québec ait les ressources nécessaires pour offrir des services de qualité sur l'ensemble du territoire québécois.

201105,62,62901,1568,2,1,Elles ont besoin que leur base économique soit en santé.
201105,62,62901,1569,1,1,Elles ont besoin qu'on soutienne leurs travailleuses et leurs travailleurs pour contrer l'exode au moindre coup dur dans l'économie.
201105,62,62901,1570,NA,NA,Ce sont ces besoins que l'équipe du Bloc Québécois se propose de défendre à Ottawa.
201105,62,62901,1573,NA,NA,"«La crise [forestière] est tout aussi forte, et même plus, que celle dans le secteur de l'automobile,  puisqu'elle touche 825000 travailleurs,  comparativement à 500000 travailleurs [au Canada]."

201105,62,62901,1575,NA,NA,Le Québec compte 230 villes et villages qui dépendent majoritairement de l'industrie forestière dont 160 dépendent exclusivement de la forêt : cela représente plus de 88 000 emplois.
201105,62,62901,1576,NA,NA,En fait près de la moitié des collectivités forestières au Canada se trouvent au Québec.
201105,62,62901,1577,NA,NA,"Depuis avril 2005, ce sont plus de 25 000 emplois qui ont été perdus à cause de la crise qui frappe le secteur forestier québécois."
201105,62,62901,1578,NA,NA,"Et en l'absence de mesures de soutien, de nombreux autres sont à risque."
201105,62,62901,1579,NA,NA,"Malheureusement, Ottawa fait la sourde oreille aux demandes de l'industrie."
201105,62,62901,1580,NA,NA,"Alors qu'il consacre 10 milliards de dollars au secteur automobile, concentré en Ontario, l'industrie forestière, elle, n'a reçu qu'un maigre 170 millions de dollars, soit près de 60 fois moins."
201105,62,62901,1581,NA,NA,Cet immobilisme est d'autant plus scandaleux que l'industrie forestière est une industrie d'avenir.
201105,62,62901,1582,NA,NA,"En effet, lorsque géré de façon responsable, le bois est une ressource renouvelable."
201105,62,62901,1583,NA,NA,"Ainsi, en plus des mesures proposées par le Bloc Québécois pour l'innovation, la recherche et le développement dont bénéficiera l'industrie forestière afin de moderniser sa production d'autres propositions sont mises de l'avant par le Bloc Québécois pour préparer la relance de l'industrie forestière."
201105,62,62901,1584,NA,NA,16.1.1 Le Bloc Québécois pressera le gouvernement de mettre en place un ensemble de mesures pour soutenir l'industrie forestière et lui permettre de surmonter la crise.
201105,62,62901,1585,NA,NA,"Il devra l'accompagner dans sa transition pour qu'elle devienne plus verte et ajoute davantage de valeur au bois transformé, notamment par la valorisation de la deuxième et de la troisième transformation."
201105,62,62901,1587,NA,NA,L'accès au crédit est le principal problème auquel est confrontée l'industrie forestière.
201105,62,62901,1588,NA,NA,"Lorsque les institutions financières ne refusent pas simplement d'accorder des prêts au secteur forestier, elles le font à des taux prohibitifs, ce qui entraîne des frais d'intérêts insoutenables pour les entreprises."

201105,62,62901,1591,NA,NA,"Par l'entremise d'Exportation et développement Canada et de la Banque de développement du Canada, le gouvernement doit mettre en place un guichet unique qui offrirait aux entreprises du secteur forestier des prêts et des garanties de prêts."
201105,62,62901,1592,NA,NA,"Ainsi, les entreprises forestières auraient accès à un guichet unique et pourraient obtenir du financement à un taux commercial raisonnable, ce qui leur permettrait de traverser la crise."

201105,62,62901,1598,NA,NA,L'utilisation du bois dans les constructions fédérales permettrait à nos entreprises de développer de nouveaux produits de deuxième et troisième transformation et de trouver de nouveaux marchés pour les produits d'ici.
201105,62,62901,1599,NA,NA,"Par ailleurs, il existe en Europe des politiques d'utilisation du bois dans la construction pour des raisons environnementales."
201105,62,62901,1600,NA,NA,"En effet, en plus de capter le dioxyde de carbone, le bois représente une solution de rechange écologique aux matériaux de construction à haute intensité énergétique."
201105,62,62901,1601,NA,NA,16.1.3Le Bloc Québécois propose la mise en place d'une politique globale de soutien et de modernisation de l'industrie forestière comprenant une politique d'utilisation du bois dans les constructions fédérales.
201105,62,62901,1603,NA,NA,"Pour trouver de nouveaux débouchés aux résidus forestiers, plusieurs mesures peuvent être mises en place, dont l'utilisation des biocarburants de remplacement de seconde génération."

201105,62,62901,1767,NA,NA,Le premier ministre a annoncé récemment qu'elles seraient toutes reprises par le gouvernement conservateur pour un investissement total de 75 millions de dollars.
201105,62,62901,1768,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement conservateur a indiqué que certaines recommandations étaient déjà appliquées, mais que d'autres prendraient plus de temps à mettre en place."
201105,62,62901,1769,NA,NA,"Au demeurant, Ottawa a fait une croix sur la possibilité de compensations pour les familles dont les proches sont décédés."
201105,62,62901,1770,NA,NA,"Après cet épisode, plusieurs autres rappels massifs d'aliments ont été effectués, comme celui de G. Brandt Méat Packers Ltd. Confronté à cet état de fait, le gouvernement conservateur admettait finalement son laxisme en matière d'inspection des aliments."
201105,62,62901,1771,NA,NA,"Par ailleurs, le gouvernement tarde toujours à mettre en œuvre les recommandations que le Bureau du vérificateur général réitère depuis pas moins de 12 ans."

201105,62,62901,1781,NA,NA,Le débat sur l'origine des produits et sur l'innocuité des aliments a fait ressurgir celui sur ['étiquetage en général et notamment sur l'étiquetage des aliments génétiquement modifiés.
201105,62,62901,1782,NA,NA,La position du Bloc Québécois reste toujours la même en ce qui a trait à la protection du consommateur : nous avons le droit de savoir et de choisir ce qu'il y a dans notre assiette !
201105,62,62901,1783,NA,NA,"Ainsi, en matière d'OGM, seul un système d'étiquetage obligatoire permettrait à celles et ceux qui ne veulent pas consommer d'aliments génétiquement modifiés de choisir en toute connaissance de cause les aliments qu'ils achètent."
201105,62,62901,1784,NA,NA,"C'est d'ailleurs dans cette optique que le Bloc Québécois avait déposé le projet de loi C-517 en février 20087, mais son initiative a été rejetée."
201105,62,62901,1785,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois a fait part à maintes reprises de ses inquiétudes quant à l'absence d'un étiquetage obligatoire des aliments génétiquement modifiés, de l'insuffisance des zones de protection et du manque de transparence du gouvernement fédéral."
201105,62,62901,1786,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois réclame aussi depuis longtemps que le Canada ratifie le protocole de Carthagène sur les OGM et la biosécurité, qui vise à mettre en place des balises de contrôle axées sur le principe de précaution concernant ce type de culture."

201105,62,62901,1793,NA,NA,"Le 30 juin 2009, le gouvernement conservateur a établi une norme concernant l'appellation «produit biologique»."
201105,62,62901,1794,NA,NA,"Presque simultanément, il a signé une entente de réciprocité avec les États-Unis permettant à l'industrie agroalimentaire américaine d'utiliser le logo «Régime Bio-Canada » sans avoir à se conformer aux normes canadiennes."
201105,62,62901,1795,NA,NA,"Selon Ottawa, si l'industrie agroalimentaire américaine respecte les normes américaines, il n'y a pas de problème."
201105,62,62901,1796,NA,NA,"En effet, le gouvernement fédéral considère désormais «équivalentes» les normes américaines et canadiennes."
201105,62,62901,1797,NA,NA,"Pourtant, certains additifs permis aux États-Unis ne sont pas encore homologués ou sont interdits au Canada."
201105,62,62901,1798,NA,NA,"Les producteurs et les transformateurs québécois, eux, ont dû attendre plusieurs mois avant que les pressions du Bloc Québécois exercées sur le gouvernement portent leurs fruits et qu'ils puissent obtenir ce même privilège !"
201105,62,62901,1799,NA,NA,C'est le 21 décembre suivant que le gouvernement fédéral a finalement annoncé que les produits certifiés biologiques selon les normes québécoises allaient désormais être reconnus conformes aux normes fédérales.
201105,62,62901,1800,NA,NA,"Ainsi, les organismes de certification du Québec pourront déclarer conformes des produits qui auront la possibilité d'arborer le logo canadien de certification biologique."
201105,62,62901,1801,NA,NA,"Cette entente Québec-Canada est valide jusqu'en juin 2011, c'est-à-dire jusqu'à la fin de la période de transition prescrite par le règlement fédéral."

201105,62,62901,1805,NA,NA,Les productrices et producteurs agricoles québécois doivent composer avec un retard considérable dans l'homologation des outils de gestion de production comme les pesticides.
201105,62,62901,1806,NA,NA,"Cette problématique touche surtout les producteurs de grandes cultures, les maraîchers et les horticulteurs."
201105,62,62901,1807,NA,NA,"Les États-Unis représentant notre principal marché, une certaine harmonisation des normes d'homologation et d'utilisation des pesticides s'avérerait fort bénéfique pour les producteurs et productrices d'ici."
201105,62,62901,1808,NA,NA,"Santé Canada, l'Agence de réglementation de la lutte antiparasitaire (ARLA) et l'Agence canadienne d'inspection des aliments exigent que les produits utilisés au Canada satisfassent aux exigences scientifiques en vertu des lois et règlements en vigueur au Canada."
201105,62,62901,1809,NA,NA,"Certains fabricants sont réticents à l'idée d'investir du temps et de l'argent pour faire homologuer des produits au Canada, surtout si les évaluations scientifiques ont déjà été entreprises dans d'autres pays."
201105,62,62901,1810,NA,NA,"Ainsi, le marché canadien n'est pas assez important pour justifier une duplication des procédés et les investissements qui en découlent."
201105,62,62901,1811,NA,NA,"Certains produits, dont l'utilisation n'est pas acceptée au Canada, sont utilisés pour la production de produits agroalimentaires importés au Canada."
201105,62,62901,1812,NA,NA,"Effectivement, plusieurs pesticides sont utilisés aux États-Unis et sont parfois même importés au Canada sans que le pesticide en question ne soit homologué ou que son utilisation ne soit approuvée ici."
201105,62,62901,1813,NA,NA,"Il y a donc un accès très inégal à ce type de produits, ce qui rend les productrices et producteurs québécois potentiellement moins productifs et rentables que leurs homologues américains."
201105,62,62901,1814,NA,NA,"18.2.5Le Bloc Québécois est favorable à une accélération du processus d'homologation de certains pesticides tant et aussi longtemps que cela n'engendre pas un nivellement par le bas des normes canadiennes, lesquelles sont souvent moins strictes que les normes québécoises."
201105,62,62901,1815,NA,NA,"18.2.6 De plus, le Bloc Québécois suivra de près le développement des études en cours par l'Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques (OCDE) et l'Accord de libre-échange nord-américain (ALÉNA) au sujet d'une possible harmonisation des normes d'homologation de leurs membres."
201105,62,62901,1818,NA,NA,"4-2,5 % des recettes agricoles québécoises proviennent des productions sous gestion de l'offre"

201105,62,62901,1822,NA,NA,En effet une telle entente aurait eu pour effet d'affaiblir considérablement le système de gestion de ['offre (baisse des tarifs hors contingents et baisse des contingents protégeant les produits sous gestion de l'offre).
201105,62,62901,1823,NA,NA,"Cependant, le fait que les deux ministres conservateurs délégués à Genève pour épauler le négociateur en chef du Canada se soient dits «très déçus» de l'échec des négociations n'a pas de quoi rassurer les producteurs du Québec !"
201105,62,62901,1824,NA,NA,"De plus, les propos du secrétaire parlementaire à ['agriculture, David Anderson, à l'effet que les producteurs de grains profiteraient d'un accord à ['Organisation mondiale du commerce (0MC) (impliquant la fin du monopole de la Commission canadienne du blé, un outil de mise en marché collective, comme le système de gestion de ['offre) et de la baisse des tarifs douaniers, n'ont rien de bien rassurant non plus."
201105,62,62901,1825,NA,NA,"Mais en attendant une reprise sérieuse des négociations à Doha, une autre menace plane sur la gestion de l'offre : les accords de libre-échange bilatéraux."
201105,62,62901,1826,NA,NA,"Dans le passé, la gestion de l'offre a toujours été exclue des éléments de négociation des accords de libre-échange."
201105,62,62901,1827,NA,NA,"Or, le Canada négocie présentement une entente de libre-échange avec l'Union européenne et le ministre du Commerce international est incapable d'affirmer clairement que la gestion de l'offre ne sera pas touchée par cet accord, puisque, nous dit-on, «tout est sur la table»."
201105,62,62901,1828,NA,NA,18.3.1 Le Bloc Québécois maintiendra son appui inconditionnel au système de la gestion de l'offre.
201105,62,62901,1829,NA,NA,"18.3.2 De même, le Bloc Québécois s'opposera à tout projet de loi entérinant des accords commerciaux (bilatéraux ou multilatéraux) mettant en péril les principes fondamentaux du système de la gestion de l'offre."
201105,62,62901,1831,NA,NA,"Peu de pays ont autant négligé leur secteur agricole que le Canada, et cela ne date pas d'hier."
201105,62,62901,1832,NA,NA,"Selon les calculs de l'UPA, la part du budget fédéral consacrée à l'agriculture est passée de près de 4 % en 1991-1992 à moins de 2 % en 2005-2006."
201105,62,62901,1833,NA,NA,"Paradoxalement, en 2003, les ministres fédéral, provinciaux et territoriaux ont signé le Cadre stratégique pour l'agriculture (CSA), un accord de cinq ans (2003-2008) visant à financer de nouveaux programmes et à assurer l'atteinte d'objectifs communs, notamment dans les domaines de la salubrité et de la qualité des aliments, de l'environnement, de la science et de l'innovation et de la gestion des risques de l'entreprise."
201105,62,62901,1835,NA,NA,"Le Programme canadien de stabilisation du revenu agricole (PCSRA) est un programme «d'assurance-revenu » issu de la première mouture du Cadre stratégique agricole, qui permet aux producteurs et productrices de bénéficier d'une protection contre une variation de leur revenu."
201105,62,62901,1836,NA,NA,"Les producteurs québécois versent une cotisation à la Financière agricole (qui gère ce programme pour le Québec) et, selon le taux de couverture voulu, les deux gouvernements se partagent le coût de l'indemnisation8."
201105,62,62901,1837,NA,NA,L'indemnisation est attribuée si le producteur dénote une différence mportante entre sa marge de production (ses revenus de l'année en cours) et sa marge de référence.
201105,62,62901,1838,NA,NA,La marge de référence étant la moyenne olympique des marges de production des cinq dernières années9.
201105,62,62901,1839,NA,NA,"Le problème de ce programme tient au fait que le gouvernement fédéral sous-évalue systématiquement les coûts de production, en fixant ses prix de référence en fonction des coûts dans des pays où l'agriculture est fortement subventionnée."
201105,62,62901,1840,NA,NA,"Or, ces subventions viennent diminuer les coûts de production, ce qui fait que les coûts sur lesquels le gouvernement se base pour évaluer [es compensations ne reflètent pas du tout les coûts réels."
201105,62,62901,1841,NA,NA,Les gouvernements du Québec et du Canada se partageront les indemnisations à 20 %-80 % lorsque l'entreprise agricole a un taux de couverture de 70 %.
201105,62,62901,1842,NA,NA,Ils se partageront les coûts à 30 %-70 % lorsque le taux de couverture choisi se situe entre 70 % et 85 %.
201105,62,62901,1843,NA,NA,"Finalement, si le taux de couverture est entre 85 % et 100 %, les gouvernements se partagent moitié-moitié le coût des indemnités."
201105,62,62901,1844,NA,NA,En ne comptabilisant pas la plus élevée et la plus faible.
201105,62,62901,1845,NA,NA,"Or, le PCSRA est conçu pour pallier les fluctuations, pas pour faire face à une baisse prolongée des prix."
201105,62,62901,1846,NA,NA,"Comme Ottawa ne compense les producteurs et productrices que si leurs revenus sont nférieurs à la moyenne des cinq dernières années, ceux dont les revenus se sont effondrés depuis plus de cinq ans ne reçoivent rien."
201105,62,62901,1847,NA,NA,"C'est ce qui est arrivé aux producteurs de culture commerciale, notamment le maïs, qui vendaient leur production au prix mondial très bas, mais dont les coûts de production sont élevés."
201105,62,62901,1849,NA,NA,"Décrié par l'ensemble des producteurs agricoles, le PCSRA devait être modifié et amélioré lors de la conception de la seconde mouture du CSA, signé en 2008. Effectivement, le programme a été scindé en deux, et donc remplacé par deux programmes conjoints (Agri-stabilité et Agri-investissement)."
201105,62,62901,1850,NA,NA,"Le problème, c'est qu'il a changé de nom seulement!"
201105,62,62901,1851,NA,NA,"On a conservé pratiquement les mêmes critères d'admissibilité, les mêmes règles de calculs et donc, les mêmes problèmes !"
201105,62,62901,1852,NA,NA,"Il y a quelques années, les producteurs de céréales ont connu de graves difficultés financières à cause d'une chute importante et prolongée des prix."
201105,62,62901,1853,NA,NA,"Hélas, à l'heure actuelle, si les producteurs de céréales ont retrouvé le chemin de la rentabilité par l'exploitation du créneau des biocarburants et de la biomasse, c'est au tour des producteurs de porcs et de bovins de connaître une situation difficile."
201105,62,62901,1854,NA,NA,"Plusieurs facteurs font en sorte de maintenir le niveau des prix exceptionnellement bas pour ces deux types d'élevage, et donc le programme de soutien du revenu (Agri-stabilité) ne fait pas le travail."
201105,62,62901,1855,NA,NA,"Ainsi, le gouvernement doit absolument écouter les productrices et producteurs et améliorer réellement son principal programme de soutien et de stabilisation des revenus afin qu'il aide véritablement celles et ceux qui en ont le plus besoin."
201105,62,62901,1857,NA,NA,Le milieu agricole vit une importante crise des revenus.
201105,62,62901,1858,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois propose depuis longtemps la mise sur pied de programmes de stabilisation des revenus mieux adaptés aux besoins des producteurs et plus flexibles, afin qu'ils puissent mieux faire face aux fluctuations des prix et aux distorsions du marché."
201105,62,62901,1859,NA,NA,"Le Cadre stratégique pour l'agriculture (CSA) visait, à la base, à mieux soutenir et encadrer les producteurs agricoles."
201105,62,62901,1860,NA,NA,"Cependant, certains programmes du CSA ont déjà démontré leurs limites et rien n'a été fait pour les corriger dans la seconde mouture dont l'entente-cadre a été signée en avril 200Ç par les gouvernements du Canada et du Québec."
201105,62,62901,1861,NA,NA,"Pendant la campagne électorale de 2008, le gouvernement s'est attiré les faveurs de certains producteurs en annonçant une plateforme agricole contenant un programme d'aide flexible à l'image de ce que les producteurs avaient imaginé (AgriFlex)."
201105,62,62901,1863,NA,NA,500 millions de dollars (mais en réalité seulement 190 millions d'argent neuf) pour «financer des initiatives destinées à aider l'industrie agricole à s'adapter aux pressions et à accroître la productivité» (Ag ri -flexibilité).
201105,62,62901,1864,NA,NA,"Dans sa forme originale (AgriFlex), ce « programme » représentait en fait une enveloppe fédérale mise à la disposition du Québec et des provinces afin de financer une forme de partenariat avec des programmes québécois de soutien aux revenus."
201105,62,62901,1865,NA,NA,18.4.1 Le Bloc Québécois restera vigilant quant à l'efficacité de ces nouveaux programmes et continuera de réclamer la mise sur pied d'un véritable programme AgriFlex.
201105,62,62901,1866,NA,NA,"Cette enveloppe de financement fédéral permettrait au Québec de créer de nouveaux programmes, y compris des programmes de gestion du risque de l'entreprise (GRE), qui répondraient aux besoins des agriculteurs et dont les coûts seraient en partie assumés par le gouvernement fédéral."
201105,62,62901,1868,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois et la Fédération de l'UPA de la Côte-du-Sud ont organisé un colloque sur la relève agricole en janvier 2005.
201105,62,62901,1869,NA,NA,18.5.1 Ce colloque a mené à la formulation de cinq propositions ayant pour objectif de favoriser l'établissement de la relève agricole au Québec.
201105,62,62901,1871,NA,NA,"accroître le montant admissible à la déduction pour gain en capital pour biens agricoles à 1 million de dollars, et ce, seulement pour les transactions à la suite desquelles il y aurait maintien de l'exploitation afin que le transfert d'une ferme soit plus rentable que son démantèlement;"
201105,62,62901,1872,NA,NA,"étendre la règle du transfert à d'autres membres de la famille immédiate âgés de moins de 40 ans (ex. : frère et sœur, neveu et nièce, etc.) plutôt que de la limiter seulement aux enfants, petits-enfants et conjoints de ces derniers ;"
201105,62,62901,1873,NA,NA,"cj constituer un régime d'épargne-transfert agricole, avec contribution de l'État, afin de permettre aux producteurs et productrices d'accumuler un fonds de retraite à l'abri de l'impôt."
201105,62,62901,1874,NA,NA,Les gouvernements pourraient y apporter une contribution comme pour le régime d'épargne-études. Cette contribution serait conditionnelle au maintien de la ferme lors du transfert;
201105,62,62901,1875,NA,NA,"assouplir les règles du Régime d'accession à la propriété (RAP) pour permettre aux jeunes producteurs d'obtenir, en tout ou en partie, une plus grande part d'une résidence détenue par une société et d'utiliser leur REER pour faire l'acquisition d'une entreprise agricole ;"
201105,62,62901,1876,NA,NA,ransférer une enveloppe récurrente au gouvernement du Québec pour favoriser la relève agricole.
201105,62,62901,1877,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois va cependant encore plus loin.
201105,62,62901,1878,NA,NA,"En effet, lors du colloque de 2005, l'objectif commun des deux groupes consistait à sauvegarder les 32 000 fermes sur le territoire québécois."
201105,62,62901,1879,NA,NA,"Or, quatre ans plus tard, ce nombre a diminué à 2Ç 500..."
201105,62,62901,1880,NA,NA,"Il fa ut donc faire plus, et plus vite !"
201105,62,62901,1881,NA,NA,"La relève agricole, c'est l'agriculture de demain."
201105,62,62901,1882,NA,NA,C'est un investissement dans l'assurance d'une bonne gestion de nos ressources et de la protection relative de notre mode de production.
201105,62,62901,1883,NA,NA,18.5.2 Le Bloc Québécois s'engage à travailler étroitement avec le monde agricole en vue de développer d'autres mesures susceptibles de compléter les cinq mesures qu'il a déjà mises de l'avant.
201105,62,62901,1885,NA,NA,"Quand on veut promouvoir la souveraineté alimentaire, on doit non seulement permettre aux producteurs de se prendre en main et de s'impliquer à tous les stades de la chaîne de production, mais on se doit aussi d'augmenter notre autonomie par rapport aux ressources étrangères."
201105,62,62901,1886,NA,NA,L'exemple de l'acquisition de l'abattoir Levinoff-Colbex par les producteurs en dit long !
201105,62,62901,1887,NA,NA,Libéraux et conservateurs ont toujours agi de manière à rendre plus difficiles l'acquisition et le fonctionnement de l'entreprise.
201105,62,62901,1888,NA,NA,"On reconnaît le problème, mais on ne fait rien pour le régler."
201105,62,62901,1890,NA,NA,Les nouvelles réglementations fédérales annoncées en juillet 2007 concernant l'industrie de ['abattage rendent les activités beaucoup plus complexes et coûteuses et ont ainsi porté un dur coup à cette industrie.
201105,62,62901,1891,NA,NA,"Les nouvelles normes prévoient « l'interdiction de l'usage de MRS - tissus qui peuvent abriter l'agent responsable de l'ESB - dans tous les aliments pour animaux de ferme, la nourriture pour a ni maux de compagnie et les engrais»."
201105,62,62901,1892,NA,NA,Ces nouvelles normes impliquent plusieurs conséquences coûteuses pour les abattoirs et les équarisseurs et donc indirectement pour les producteurs qui verront leurs coûts augmenter.
201105,62,62901,1893,NA,NA,"En effet, ils doivent adapter leur technologie en conséquence puisque, désormais, non seulement la farine animale n'a plus de valeur marchande, mais elle doit être enfouie aux frais de l'industrie."
201105,62,62901,1894,NA,NA,"L'abattoir a dû se moderniser et agrandir ses installations pour faire face à ces nouvelles normes, mais n'a bénéficié d'aucune aide directe du gouvernement fédéral, ni au moment de l'acquisition de Levinoff-Colbex en 2006, ni lors de l'annonce du programme d'aide pour les abattoirs de ruminants (ESB-5) la même année."
201105,62,62901,1895,NA,NA,Les producteurs et productrices ont donc dû réinvestir plus de 30 millions de dollars dans leur entreprise.
201105,62,62901,1897,NA,NA,La réglementation américaine est beaucoup plus souple que celle du Canada en ce qui a trait aux farines animales.
201105,62,62901,1898,NA,NA,"En effet, les MRS des bovins américains peuvent être transformées en farines animales et servies aux autres animaux que les bovins."
201105,62,62901,1899,NA,NA,Les industriels canadiens et québécois n'ont pas les moyens de rivaliser avec les États-Unis si ceux-ci n'adoptent pas une réglementation similaire.
201105,62,62901,1900,NA,NA,"Dans le Plan d'action économique de juin 200Ç, 50 millions de dollars ont été alloués au programme d'accroissement de la capacité des abattoirs pour l'ensemble du Canada."

201105,62,62901,2043,NA,NA,"En juin 2006, l'ancien ministre des Affaires étrangères du Canada, Peter MacKay, déclarait à la session inaugurale du Conseil des droits de l'homme, à Genève : «Le Canada a toujours été un promoteur du multilatéralisme - mais d'un multilatéralisme efficace qui sacrifie les processus aux résultats12.»"
201105,62,62901,2044,NA,NA,Cette déclaration du ministre démontre que les conservateurs adhèrent à une définition du multilatéralisme conforme à la vision que pouvait en avoir George W. Bush.
201105,62,62901,2045,NA,NA,"Tout juste avant [a guerre en Irak, les États-Unis ont agi unilatéralement parce que les discussions, selon eux, prenaient trop de temps."
201105,62,62901,2046,NA,NA,La position des conservateurs n'était donc qu'une adhésion de façade au multilatéralisme.
201105,62,62901,2047,NA,NA,20.2.2Le Bloc Québécois est contre toute action belliqueuse unilatérale et contre toute guerre préventive.
201105,62,62901,2048,NA,NA,"Seule l'ONU peut intervenir pour tenter de régler un conflit et, ultimement, conformément à ses règles, autoriser une intervention d'imposition ou de maintien de la paix."
201105,62,62901,2050,NA,NA,L'un des principes qui guident l'action de l'ONU est d'éviter que des interventions ne se fassent en dehors du droit international et de l'aval du Conseil de sécurité.
201105,62,62901,2051,NA,NA,"Pourtant, dans certaines situations, la communauté internationale a la responsabilité de protéger les populations comme au Rwanda en 1994, par exemple."
201105,62,62901,2052,NA,NA,"Une intervention militaire, même non sanctionnée par le Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies peut être justifiée pour éviter des violations massives des droits humains."
201105,62,62901,2054,NA,NA,"Pour des raisons humanitaires, guidé par la position prise par le Conseil de l'Europe, le Bloc Québécois avait appuyé l'intervention au Kosovo."
201105,62,62901,2055,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois aurait fait de même au sujet du Rwanda et il aurait appuyé l'envoi de soldats additionnels dans cette région du globe.
201105,62,62901,2056,NA,NA,"20.2.3Exceptionnellement, lorsque le Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies n'arrive pas à prendre position et que des populations se trouvent victimes de graves crimes de guerre, de crimes contre l'humanité ou de génocide, le Bloc Québécois pourrait appuyer une intervention visant à protéger les populations civiles."
201105,62,62901,2058,NA,NA,Le gouvernement Harper n'a jamais présenté de politique étrangère pour orienter l'action nternationale du Canada.
201105,62,62901,2059,NA,NA,"Depuis son arrivée au pouvoir, les décisions prises sur la scène nternationale font la preuve de son entêtement idéologique et vont à l'encontre des positions traditionnelles du Canada et des valeurs de la nation québécoise."
201105,62,62901,2060,NA,NA,"En se collant sur des positions idéologiques, le gouvernement Harper s'est mis à dos des alliés importants du Canada, dont bon nombre de pays européens."
201105,62,62901,2061,NA,NA,L'arrivée des conservateurs au pouvoir a engendré un glissement dans la politique étrangère canadienne et le respect du droit international.
201105,62,62901,2062,NA,NA,Le gouvernement délaisse de plus en plus le rôle traditionnel du Canada en matière de relations nternationales pour adopter des partis pris idéologiques et protéger des intérêts spécifiques.
201105,62,62901,2063,NA,NA,"Il semble tout particulièrement y avoir rupture avec la tradition diplomatique du Canada au Proche-Orient qui, en tant que médiateur apprécié, défendait le droit international plutôt que de défendre l'un ou l'autre des belligérants."
201105,62,62901,2064,NA,NA,Le gouvernement de Stephen Harper évacue tout débat sur les orientations de la politique étrangère de son gouvernement.
201105,62,62901,2065,NA,NA,"Sans politique étrangère, un gouvernement ne saurait avoir de politique de défense."
201105,62,62901,2066,NA,NA,"Or, depuis l'élection des conservateurs, le seul débat sur la politique étrangère portait sur l'Afghanistan."
201105,62,62901,2067,NA,NA,Le reste est gardé sous silence.
201105,62,62901,2068,NA,NA,Cela est d'autant plus grave qu'il y a eu une hausse considérable des budgets alloués à la défense.
201105,62,62901,2070,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois croit que cette région doit être développée dans le respect de certains principes.
201105,62,62901,2071,NA,NA,"Premièrement, toute action dans l'Arctique doit tenir compte des populations qui y vivent notamment les Inuits."
201105,62,62901,2072,NA,NA,"Ensuite, l'exploitation des ressources dans le Nord doit être suivie de près et encadrée afin que la région ne soit pas livrée à un pillage des ressources."
201105,62,62901,2073,NA,NA,"Troisièmement, il faut lutter contre les changements climatiques qui entraînent des conséquences importantes pour l'Arctique et protéger adéquatement l'extrême fragilité de ses écosystèmes."
201105,62,62901,2074,NA,NA,"Finalement tout litige frontalier doit être résolu pacifiquement et diplomatiquement, dans le respect du droit nternational et des principes du multilatéralisme."
201105,62,62901,2075,NA,NA,"Pour le Bloc Québécois, toute solution dans l'Arctique doit impliquer et mettre à contribution les nuits qui y habitent."
201105,62,62901,2076,NA,NA,"D'une part, il faut intégrer ceux-ci au processus de négociation et, d'autre part, les aider à développer leur économie."
201105,62,62901,2077,NA,NA,"Sur le plan politique, le Bloc Québécois a toujours privilégié une approche basée sur la diplomatie et le multilatéralisme plutôt que sur la stratégie musclée. En ce sens, le gouvernement canadien doit entretenir de bonnes relations avec les États circumpolaires."
201105,62,62901,2078,NA,NA,Il faut donc éviter d'agir d'une manière qui favoriserait l'intensification des tensions.
201105,62,62901,2079,NA,NA,C'est pourquoi nous encourageons le Canada à œuvrer dans les limites du droit international afin de bien asseoir sa souveraineté.
201105,62,62901,2080,NA,NA,"La Commission des limites du plateau continental, ainsi que le prévoit la Convention des Nations Unies sur le droit de la mer, s'avère un excellent forum de discussion."
201105,62,62901,2081,NA,NA,"Par ailleurs, compte tenu de l'extrême fragilité des écosystèmes, le Canada doit redoubler d'efforts au Conseil de l'Arctique pour que les pays nordiques s'entendent sur des mesures visant notamment à respecter l'environnement, encadrer l'exploitation des ressources, démilitariser la région et assurer la participation des peuples autochtones à ces initiatives."
201105,62,62901,2083,NA,NA,L'intervention des États-Unis en Irak a constitué un test difficile pour la communauté internationale.
201105,62,62901,2084,NA,NA,"Malgré les informations à l'effet qu'il n'y avait pas d'arme de destruction massive en Irak fournies notamment par la Commission de contrôle, de vérification et d'inspection des Nations Unies, George W. Bush insistait sur la nécessité d'une guerre préventive."
201105,62,62901,2085,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois, à l'image des milliers de Québécoises et de Québécois qui ont défilé à Montréal à l'hiver 2003, a maintenu queleCanadane devait en aucun cas envisager une participation militaire en Irak tant que celle-ci s'accomplissait en dehors d'un mandat des Nations Unies."
201105,62,62901,2086,NA,NA,"Or, à cette époque, Stephen Harper et Michael Ignatieff étaient en accord avec le président George W. Bush et prônaient un engagement militaire du Canada."
201105,62,62901,2087,NA,NA,"Certes, ils ont fait leur mea culpa, mais une chose est certaine : si l'un ou l'autre avait été premier ministre, le Canada aurait participé à cette guerre illégale et immorale."
201105,62,62901,2088,NA,NA,"20.5.1 Le Bloc Québécois rejette avec force la notion de guerre préventive par laquelle un pays s'arroge le droit d'en attaquer un autre, même en l'absence de menace avérée et imminente."
201105,62,62901,2090,NA,NA,"Depuis que les conservateurs sont au pouvoir, les libéraux de Michael Ignatieff tentent de s'afficher comme la solution de rechange aux conservateurs, défenseurs de la paix mondiale et des droits de la personne au niveau international."
201105,62,62901,2091,NA,NA,Peut-on néanmoins croire les promesses libérales en la matière?
201105,62,62901,2092,NA,NA,Les libéraux ont un lourd passé sur cette question.
201105,62,62901,2094,NA,NA,aurait engagé le Canada dans la guerre en Irak en 2003
201105,62,62901,2095,NA,NA,s'est également déclaré en faveur de la torture psychologique sur ceux que l'on soupçonne de terrorisme.
201105,62,62901,2097,NA,NA,"•ont sabré dans les budgets d'aide internationale, les faisant passer d'un sommet de 0,4-8 % du PIB à un maigre 0,23 % peu avant leur départ"
201105,62,62901,2098,NA,NA,ont tout d'abord refusé de rapatrier l'enfant soldat Omar Khadr de la prison de Guantanamo
201105,62,62901,2099,NA,NA,ont également mis en place un accord sur le transfert de prisonniers afghans sans négocier des mécanismes de suivi et de surveillance des détenus afin de s'assurer qu'ils ne soient pas torturés
201105,62,62901,2100,NA,NA,ont refusé de poser les droits de la personne comme condition d'admission de la Chine à l'OMC.
201105,62,62901,2101,NA,NA,Ces quelques exemples ouvrent la voie à une question importante : peut-on faire confiance aux libéraux pour défendre des valeurs intrinsèquement québécoises au niveau international?
201105,62,62901,2103,NA,NA,Une triste constante se dégage des agissements du gouvernement Harper : le peu de cas qu'il fait des ressortissantes et ressortissants détenus à l'étranger.
201105,62,62901,2104,NA,NA,"Les exemples sont nombreux : Omar Khadr, dont le gouvernement conteste jusqu'en Cour suprême les jugements ordonnant de le rapatrier même s'il s'agit d'un enfant-soldat; Suaad Hagi Mohamud, détenue au Kenya pendant trois mois qui, non seulement n'a pas reçu l'aide qu'elle était en droit d'attendre du gouvernement canadien, mais accuse celui-ci d'avoir contribué à son calvaire; et Abousfian Abdelrazik, un citoyen canadien d'origine soudanaise accusé injustement par le Soudan d'être un terroriste et à qui le gouvernement refusait obstinément de délivrer un passeport qui lu aurait permis de revenir au Canada jusqu'à ce qu'un jugement lui ordonne de le faire."
201105,62,62901,2105,NA,NA,"Que dire de la Québécoise Nathalie Morin, séquestrée par son mari avec ses trois enfants?"
201105,62,62901,2106,NA,NA,"Malgré ses nombreux appels à l'aide, l'ambassade canadienne ne lui a été d'aucun secours."
201105,62,62901,2107,NA,NA,"Ce sont également les tribunaux qui ont dû forcer la main au gouvernement conservateur, concernant les peines de mort prononcées à l'étranger contre des citoyens canadiens."
201105,62,62901,2108,NA,NA,"Sans débat aucun, les conservateurs avaient décidé de changer la politique qui consistait à demander que les peines de mort soient commuées en peines de prison."
201105,62,62901,2109,NA,NA,Ils préfèrent une approche au «cas par cas» où la vie est négociable !
201105,62,62901,2110,NA,NA,"Bref, avec le gouvernement conservateur, la présomption d'innocence ne tient plus."
201105,62,62901,2111,NA,NA,Les Canadiennes et les Canadiens qui ont des démêlés avec la justice à l'étranger sont présumés coupables et ne peuvent plus compter sur l'appui du gouvernement canadien pour défendre leurs droits fondamentaux.
201105,62,62901,2112,NA,NA,20.7.1 Le Bloc Québécois fera une priorité du respect des droits des ressortissantes et des ressortissants à l'étranger en enjoignant le gouvernement d'adopter et de mettre en place les mécanismes protégeant leurs droits.
201105,62,62901,2114,NA,NA,C'est sous le gouvernement de Brian Mulroney que fut créé l'organisme Droits et Démocratie.
201105,62,62901,2115,NA,NA,Cet organisme s'est bâti une solide réputation à l'international.
201105,62,62901,2116,NA,NA,Le développement de la démocratie devait se faire en s'appuyant sur les droits.
201105,62,62901,2117,NA,NA,"L'éducation, la justice, l'égalité et l'information sont indispensables à une vraie démocratie."
201105,62,62901,2118,NA,NA,Cette politique signifiait évidemment que la direction de Droits et Démocratie devait prendre ses distances avec le gouvernement canadien au pouvoir pour faire adéquatement son travail et conserver sa crédibilité.
201105,62,62901,2119,NA,NA,Les conservateurs ne l'entendaient pas ainsi.
201105,62,62901,2120,NA,NA,"Non seulement y a-t-il eu des nominations partisanes qui ne répondaient pas aux critères d'expertise prévus dans la loi, mais un virage idéologique a été imposé par une courte majorité de personnes nouvellement nommées au conseil d'administration."
201105,62,62901,2121,NA,NA,Des employés ont été sujets à de l'intimidation et du harcèlement. Certains ont été suspendus.
201105,62,62901,2122,NA,NA,Ce fut une situation incompatible avec l'esprit qui avait présidé à la naissance de Droits et Démocratie.
201105,62,62901,2123,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois est d'avis que le gouvernement conservateur doit redonnera Droits et Démocratie les conditions qui lui permettront d'effectuer son important travail dans une ambiance saine, respectueuse des employés et conforme aux valeurs qu'il a défendues pendant ses 25 ans d'existence."
201105,62,62901,2124,NA,NA,20.8.1 Le Bloc Québécois exige que le gouvernement fédéral reconstitue le conseil d'administration de Droits et Démocratie et que celui-ci décide s'il garde ou non le nouveau président.
201105,62,62901,2125,NA,NA,Il doit également déclencher une enquête indépendante afin de faire la lumière sur les sérieuses allégations à l'égard de certains membres du conseil d'administration.
201105,62,62901,2126,NA,NA,"Également, des excuses doivent être présentées à la famille de l'ancien président de Droits et Démoicratie, Rémy Beauregard, concernant les fausses accusations à son égard."
201105,62,62901,2127,NA,NA,"Finalement, avant la nomination des nouveaux membres, le Comité permanent des affaires étrangères devrait avoir une période de 30 jours de séances pour étudier les candidatures au conseil d'administration."
201105,62,62901,2130,NA,NA,Les partis libéral et conservateur veulent dépenser 470 milliards de dollars en achats militaires et pour la défense au cours des 20 prochaines années sans avoir présenté une véritable politique étrangère et de défense.
201105,62,62901,2131,NA,NA,"En l'absence d'une telle politique, le Bloc Québécois juge qu'il serait irresponsable de procéder à ces achats sans que les parlementaires aient pu en étudier leurs répercussions."
201105,62,62901,2133,NA,NA,"La politique de défense rendue publique le 1Ç juin 2008 et élaborée en cachette, sans consultation parlementaire, nous semble un exercice qui démontre le manque flagrant de transparence de ce gouvernement conservateur."
201105,62,62901,2134,NA,NA,"En excluant les parlementaires, les conservateurs ont manqué de respect envers le processus démocratique."
201105,62,62901,2135,NA,NA,Nous croyons qu'il faut tenir un large débat sur le rôle que le Canada veut confier à ses Forces armées et sur le type même de forces militaires qui peuvent accomplir ce rôle.
201105,62,62901,2136,NA,NA,Des choix quant aux priorités doivent être effectués.
201105,62,62901,2137,NA,NA,"Pour sa part, le Bloc Québécois privilégie les opérations multilatérales de rétablissement et de maintien de la paix."
201105,62,62901,2138,NA,NA,"21.1.1 Le Bloc Québécois demande que le gouvernement présente une véritable politique étrangère, suivie d'une politique de défense, qui viendraient encadrer et justifier les dépenses du ministère de la Défense."
201105,62,62901,2140,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois a toujours appuyé les initiatives visant à améliorer les conditions de vie des militaires et il ne s'oppose pas systématiquement aux achats militaires.
201105,62,62901,2141,NA,NA,"Nous sommes conscients que le processus d'acquisition de matériel militaire est très lent, mais une étude des propositions d'achat de matériel devant le comité parlementaire de la défense mettrait les contribuables québécois et canadiens à l'abri des décisions précipitées prises par les conservateurs - comme celles ayant conduit à l'achat de sous-marins, de navires militaires et de F-35-"
201105,62,62901,2142,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois exigera que le gouvernement fédéral dépose pour étude au Comité permanent de la défense et des anciens combattants toute proposition d'achat d'équipement militaire de plus de 100 millions de dollars avant de procéder.
201105,62,62901,2143,NA,NA,"D'ici là, le Bloc Québécois exige un moratoire sur les achats militaires qui excèdent les dépenses courantes."
201105,62,62901,2144,NA,NA,"De plus, le gouvernement doit amorcer une réflexion sur l'après-Afghanistan, considérant que la fin de la mission lui permettra d'économiser 1,5 milliard de dollars annuellement."
201105,62,62901,2146,NA,NA,Le matériel militaire représente un marché important pour l'industrie aéronautique. Il
201105,62,62901,2147,NA,NA,s'agit de matériel de pointe porteur de retombées technologiques considérables.
201105,62,62901,2148,NA,NA,"Les achats militaires étant exclus des accords commerciaux, les gouvernements peuvent effectuer leurs achats où ils veulent et aux conditions qu'ils veulent, maximisant ainsi les retombées pour l'industrie."
201105,62,62901,2149,NA,NA,"L'industrie aéronautique québécoise représente, selon les années, entre 55 et 60 % de l'industrie aéronautique canadienne."
201105,62,62901,2150,NA,NA,"Il serait tout à fait normal qu'elle reçoive sa juste part des retombées en aéronautique des contrats fédéraux, soit entre 55 et 60 % des retombées."
201105,62,62901,2151,NA,NA,"Mais en n'agissant pas pour qu'il y ait des retombées au Québec, Ottawa affaiblit le seul vrai pôle en aéronautique au Canada."
201105,62,62901,2152,NA,NA,"En outre, le gouvernement fédéral a annoncé en juin 2010 une stratégie de construction navale où 35 milliards de dollars seraient dépensés sur 30 ans."
201105,62,62901,2153,NA,NA,"Comme il l'a fait pour l'industrie aérospatiale, le gouvernement fédéral ne doit pas laisser pour compte l'industrie navale du Québec."
201105,62,62901,2154,NA,NA,Une politique d'achat de matériel militaire est donc nécessaire : le Québec ne veut pas la charité il veut sa juste part.
201105,62,62901,2156,NA,NA,Offrir la priorité aux fournisseurs canadiens
201105,62,62901,2157,NA,NA,"Lorsque aucun fournisseur canadien n'est en mesure d'offrir le bien en question, veiller à ce que le contrat passé à l'étranger génère des retombées intéressantes et structurantes au Canada"
201105,62,62901,2158,NA,NA,"Veiller à ce que ces retombées soient réparties d'une manière équitable, c'est-à-dire d'une manière qui respecte la répartition géographique de l'industrie."
201105,62,62901,2159,NA,NA,21.3.1  Le Bloc Québécois exige que le Québec reçoive sa juste part des retombées économiques lors des achats de matériel militaire.
201105,62,62901,2161,NA,NA,"L'ombudsman de la Défense nationale et des Forces canadiennes doit être libre de l'influence ndue du ministre de la Défense et, par conséquent, doit relever du Parlement et non du gouvernement."
201105,62,62901,2162,NA,NA,Il faut tout mettre en œuvre pour assurer la pleine indépendance de l'ombudsman.
201105,62,62901,2163,NA,NA,"Or, comme cette importante fonction a été créée par une directive du gouvernement, ce dernier peut jouer à sa guise avec les fonctions et le mandat de l'ombudsman afin qu'il ne devienne pas un obstacle au programme politique du gouvernement."
201105,62,62901,2164,NA,NA,C'est pourquoi une loi devient plus que nécessaire pour encadrer les fonctions de l'ombudsman de la Défense.
201105,62,62901,2165,NA,NA,"Une fois une telle loi adoptée, l'indépendance de l'ombudsman sera mieux protégée parce qu'il est plus difficile de changer une loi qu'une directive gouvernementale."
201105,62,62901,2166,NA,NA,"21.4.1 Le Bloc Québécois exhorte le gouvernement à présenter une loi qui expliciterait le mandat de l'ombudsman de la Défense, qui encadrerait ses fonctions et qui préciserait que ce dernier doit relever du Parlement et non du gouvernement."
201105,62,62901,2168,NA,NA,Le gouvernement Harper fait grand cas de l'apport des Forces armées canadiennes aux différentes interventions militaires.
201105,62,62901,2169,NA,NA,Mais qu'en est-il de ses responsabilités lorsque certains militaires reviennent fragilisés de leur expérience (blessures physiques ou traumatismes) ?
201105,62,62901,2170,NA,NA,"Dans le cadre de son travail parlementaire, le Bloc Québécois s'est toujours soucié de l'appui qui était donné aux anciens combattants, ceux qui ont fièrement porté l'uniforme."
201105,62,62901,2171,NA,NA,"Nous avons toujours exigé que le gouvernement alloue toutes les ressources possibles à l'appui aux militaires et anciens combattants quant à leurs besoins en matière de santé, notamment ceux qui souffrent du syndrome post-traumatique."
201105,62,62901,2172,NA,NA,"Lorsque la Charte des anciens combattants a été adoptée en 2006, la pension mensuelle à vie aux militaires blessés a été remplacée par un montant forfaitaire unique."
201105,62,62901,2173,NA,NA,"Or, ce mode d'indemnisation est insuffisant et mal adapté aux besoins des militaires blessés."
201105,62,62901,2174,NA,NA,"D'une part, en cas d'invalidité, le gouvernement doit s'assurer du bien-être des militaires tant physique et psychologique que financier."
201105,62,62901,2175,NA,NA,Nous doutons que le versement d'un montant forfaitaire puisse assurer une stabilité à long terme comme pourrait le faire le versement d'une pension mensuelle à vie.
201105,62,62901,2176,NA,NA,"D'autre part, nous croyons que la solution proposée ne tient pas compte de l'état psychologique des militaires ou anciens combattants invalides."
201105,62,62901,2177,NA,NA,Soyons clairs : c'est avec empathie et compassion que le Bloc Québécois reconnaît l'état de vulnérabilité et de détresse dans lequel peuvent se retrouver les militaires et les anciens combattants invalides.
201105,62,62901,2178,NA,NA,"En conséquence, un soutien à long terme s'avère nécessaire."
201105,62,62901,2179,NA,NA,Cette demande a même été formulée par l'ombudsman des anciens combattants.
201105,62,62901,2180,NA,NA,"21.5.1 Le Bloc Québécois croit que la meilleure solution pour les militaires et anciens combattants invalides est de leur offrir une pension mensuelle à vie et que le gouvernement leur alloue toutes les ressources possibles quant à leurs besoins en matière de santé, notamment ceux qui souffrent du syndrome post-traumatique."
201105,62,62901,2182,NA,NA,La résolution adoptée par le Parlement prévoit que le Canada mettra fin à la mission militaire en Afghanistan en 2011.
201105,62,62901,2183,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement conservateur s'y est engagé à maintes reprises et le chef d'état-major canadien, le général Walter Natynczyk, a déjà affirmé que la Défense préparait le rapatriement des troupes au Canada."
201105,62,62901,2184,NA,NA,"Qui plus est, nous avons appris le 10 août 2010 que le ministère de la Défense négocie actuellement avec le ministère des Affaires étrangères afin que celui-ci prépare le terrain avec l'aide des autres pays pour faciliter le rapatriement des troupes canadiennes."
201105,62,62901,2185,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois a toujours appuyé la mission militaire de l'OTAN en Afghanistan.
201105,62,62901,2186,NA,NA,"Cependant pour ce qui est de la mission canadienne, le Bloc Québécois s'est opposé deux fois à des prolongements."
201105,62,62901,2187,NA,NA,Nous estimons donc que le Canada a fait sa part.
201105,62,62901,2188,NA,NA,Les députées et députés du Bloc Québécois l'ont affirmé dans les associations internationales auxquelles ils participent.
201105,62,62901,2189,NA,NA,C'est pourquoi nous exigeons que la mission militaire en Afghanistan prenne fin lorsqu'elle arrivera à échéance en 2011.
201105,62,62901,2190,NA,NA,"Cela dit, nous croyons que le Canada doit poursuivre son aide au développement en Afghanistan en s'assurant notamment que l'aide octroyée soit plus transparente, mieux structurée et qu'elle respecte les priorités afghanes."
201105,62,62901,2191,NA,NA,"De plus, le Canada doit accroître son travail diplomatique afin d'en arriver à une paix durable au sein du peuple afghan."
201105,62,62901,2192,NA,NA,"Pour ce faire, il doit travailler en coopération avec les pays régionaux et poursuivre la négociation diplomatique avec les insurgés."
201105,62,62901,2193,NA,NA,Cette position est parfaitement cohérente avec l'action du Bloc Québécois depuis que le Canada est présent en Afghanistan.
201105,62,62901,2194,NA,NA,"En effet, depuis janvier 2002, nous insistons sur le respect des principes du droit international humanitaire, notamment en ce qui a trait au traitement des prisonniers et des civils afghans."
201105,62,62901,2195,NA,NA,"De plus, nous avons maintes fois réclamé le rééquilibrage de la mission et l'élaboration d'une stratégie efficace pour atteindre les objectifs de pacification et de reconstruction."
201105,62,62901,2196,NA,NA,21.6.1 Le Bloc Québécois est déçu de la position des libéraux et des conservateurs de maintenir la mission en Afghanistan jusqu'en 2014.
201105,62,62901,2197,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois s'assurera que le Canada respecte la volonté des Québécois et des Canadiens en mettant fin à la mission militaire en Afghanistan le plus tôt possible avant 2014.
201105,62,62901,2198,NA,NA,"Par contre, nous voulons que le Canada poursuive son aide au développement et qu'il utilise des moyens diplomatiques pour assurer la réconciliation afghane."
201105,62,62901,2200,NA,NA,"Que ce soit en Afghanistan ou ailleurs, le Bloc Québécois a toujours défendu le principe selon lequel les individus détenus au Canada doivent être traités humainement et en respect des Conventions de Genève et de la convention contre la torture."
201105,62,62901,2201,NA,NA,Le traitement des détenus transférés par le Canada aux autorités afghanes a fait couler beaucoup d'encre ces dernières années.
201105,62,62901,2202,NA,NA,Plusieurs sources ont dénoncé les risques importants de torture occasionnés par la faiblesse de la première entente de transfert négociée sous un gouvernement libéral et signée par le général Rick Hillier en 2005-
201105,62,62901,2203,NA,NA,"Ce risque connu, le Canada n'a jamais cessé de transférer ses détenus afghans aux autorités locales, même si cela pouvait représenter une violation des Conventions de Genève."
201105,62,62901,2204,NA,NA,"Depuis que le Bloc Québécois tente de faire la lumière sur les allégations de torture de détenus afghans transférés par les militaires canadiens en Afghanistan, le gouvernement conservateur n'a cessé de tout faire pour étouffer l'affaire, notamment en prorogeant la Chambre pour contrecarrer le témoignage des témoins clés, en refusant l'accès de documents aux parlementaires travaillant sur la question et en censurant de manière injustifiée les quelques notes qu'il a finalement consenti à livrer."
201105,62,62901,2205,NA,NA,Ces tentatives du gouvernement fédéral de masquer son incompétence et son indifférence quant au sort des détenus transférés sont inacceptables !
201105,62,62901,2206,NA,NA,"Ce bras de fer entre les parlementaires et le gouvernement a mené au jugement historique du président de la Chambre des communes, lequel a tranché que le gouvernement devait se plier aux exigences des parlementaires en ce qui a trait à la production de documents et de témoins."
201105,62,62901,2207,NA,NA,Il a ordonné aux parlementaires et au gouvernement de s'entendre sur un mécanisme afin que les premiers puissent examiner les documents sur le transfert des prisonniers sans que cela ne porte atteinte à la sécurité du Canada.
201105,62,62901,2208,NA,NA,"Cependant, ce bras de fer ne doit pas conduire à l'oubli de la responsabilité première du gouvernement : il doit s'assurer que les prisonniers qu'il transfère aux autorités afghanes ne soient pas torturés."
201105,62,62901,2209,NA,NA,"21.7.1 Le Bloc Québécois exige que le gouvernement fédéral se conforme aux Conventions de Genève et qu'il suspende le transfert de détenus aux autorités, car il existe des risques de torture."
201105,62,62901,2210,NA,NA,Cette interdiction doit durer tant que les risques demeureront.
201105,62,62901,2213,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois croit que l'aide publique au développement provenant du Canada doit avoir comme objectif la réduction de la pauvreté.
201105,62,62901,2214,NA,NA,C'est pourquoi il a appuyé et continuera d'appuyer des initiatives qui assurent que l'aide publique au développement soit destinée à réduire la pauvreté portant directement atteinte à la vie et à la santé.
201105,62,62901,2215,1,0,"Néanmoins, force est de constater que le gouvernement conservateur fait fi de cela."
201105,62,62901,2216,2,-1,"Même si la Loi sur la responsabilité en matière d'aide au développement officielle stipule clairement que cette aide doit avoir comme mission la réduction de la pauvreté, le gouvernement conservateur a pigé dans cette enveloppe pour financer des programmes qui n'ont rien à voir avec la réduction de la pauvreté dans les pays en voie de développement."
201105,62,62901,2217,2,1,"Par exemple, il a financé un programme d'aide à la réinstallation des immigrantes et des immigrants au Canada, un programme de déploiement d'agents de la GRC à l'étranger, le développement des réseaux de télécommunications dans des pays en voie de développement, etc."
201105,62,62901,2218,NA,NA,Le Bloc Québécois ne s'oppose pas à ces programmes.
201105,62,62901,2219,NA,NA,Nous croyons seulement que leur financement ne devrait pas provenir de l'enveloppe de l'aide publique au développement.
201105,62,62901,2220,NA,NA,Il est nacceptable que le gouvernement canadien utilise son enveloppe d'aide au développement officiel (ADO) pour financer des initiatives et des programmes qui ne servent pas à faire du développement dans les pays pauvres.
201105,62,62901,2221,NA,NA,Les citoyennes et les citoyens du Québec et du Canada s'attendent à ce que l'aide serve aux citoyens des pays en voie de développement.
201105,62,62901,2222,NA,NA,En finançant des initiatives qui ne sont pas considérées comme de l'aide au développement au sens de la loi le Canada gonfle artificiellement l'ampleur de son aide en cette matière.
201105,62,62901,2223,NA,NA,"22.1.1 Pour le Bloc Québécois, l'aide publique au développement devrait servir à financer des programmes et initiatives visant la réduction de la pauvreté des habitants les plus vulnérables dans les pays en voie de développement, tel que l'amélioration de la salubrité, l'accès à l'eau potable et la lutte contre la malnutrition."
201105,62,62901,2225,NA,NA,"Le gouvernement canadien s'était aussi engagé à consacrer une enveloppe budgétaire équivalente à 0,7 % de son PNB à l'aide publique au développement."
201105,62,62901,2226,NA,NA,"Toutefois, à partir du début des années 1990,  le gouvernement  libéral a sabré dans les budgets,  les faisant passer d'un peu moins de 0,5 % en 1991 à 0,25 % en 2000."
201105,62,62901,2227,NA,NA,"Ils ne représentent plus aujourd'hu qu'un maigre 0,3 % du PNB."
201105,62,62901,2228,NA,NA,"En 2003, le Parlement décidait d'accroître l'aide étrangère de 8 % par année afin de la doubler d'ici 2010-2011, engagement confirmé à nouveau dans les budgets subséquents."
201105,62,62901,2229,NA,NA,"À ce rythme avec l'inflation et la croissance du PNB, le Canada ne respectera qu'en 2033 son engagement d'atteindre l'objectif de 0,7 % fixé par l'ONU, alors qu'il s'est engagé à le faire en 2015."
201105,62,62901,2230,NA,NA,"Lors du budget de 2010, le gouvernement fédéral a annoncé son intention de plafonner les budgets de l'aide au développement, confirmant ainsi qu'il n'allait pas faire les efforts qu s'imposent pour atteindre l'objectif de 0,7 % du PNB."
201105,62,62901,2231,NA,NA,"Ainsi, à mesure que l'échéance de 2015 approche, nous nous voyons forcés d'admettre que l'inaction des gouvernements fédéraux successifs rend de plus en plus illusoire la capacité du Canada à respecter cet engagement international."
201105,62,62901,2232,NA,NA,"Néanmoins, l'objectif d'accorder 0,7 % du PNB à l'aide au développement demeure louable."
201105,62,62901,2233,NA,NA,C'est pourquoi le gouvernement fédéral doit présenter un plan crédible et réaliste pour atteindre cet objectif.
201105,62,62901,2234,NA,NA,Le gouvernement fédéral doit donc accorder des hausses budgétaires à son enveloppe d'aide au développement.
201105,62,62901,2235,NA,NA,"De plus, nous avons demandé au gouvernement fédéral de présenter dans le budget 2010 un échéancier réaliste détaillant les mesures qui pourraient être mises en œuvre afin que le Canada, de concert avec les autres gouvernements, procède à l'imposition d'une taxe sur les transactions financières internationales."
201105,62,62901,2236,NA,NA,Les recettes générées pourraient être allouées à l'aide au développement.
201105,62,62901,2237,NA,NA,"22.2.1 Le Bloc Québécois demande que le gouvernement fédéral mette en place, le plus rapidement possible, un plan réaliste visant l'atteinte de la cible fixée par l'ONU, soit de verser 0,7 % du PNB à l'aide publique au développement."
201105,62,62901,2239,NA,NA,"Depuis plusieurs mois, une lourde tendance s'observe et s'installe chez les conservateurs. On"
201105,62,62901,2240,NA,NA,ne peut que s'inquiéter du désengagement important et de la politique de la peur imposés aux organisations non gouvernementales en aide internationale par le gouvernement Harper.
201105,62,62901,2241,NA,NA,Un désengagement qui est particulièrement marqué face aux besoins des organismes qu soutiennent des positions ne correspondant pas aux vues du gouvernement.
201105,62,62901,2242,NA,NA,"En effet, depuis 2009, plusieurs organismes financés par l'Agence canadienne de développement international (ACDI) doivent patienter plusieurs mois avant d'obtenir une réponse à leur demande de financement, ce qui entraîne plusieurs mises à pied, une révision parfois en profondeur de certains programmes et même dans plusieurs cas la cessation simple et entière du financement."
201105,62,62901,2243,NA,NA,"Depuis l'arrivée au pouvoir des conservateurs, l'ACDI met fin à des partenariats de plusieurs années auprès d'organismes qui ont prouvé au fil des ans leur efficacité et leur professionnalisme, des organismes qui ont démontré leur importance capitale dans l'espace démocratique."
201105,62,62901,2244,NA,NA,"Or, le gouvernement conservateur agit comme s'il était interdit de critiquer ou de remettre en question ses politiques sous peur de très dures représailles."
201105,62,62901,2245,NA,NA,Cette attitude est inqualifiable et inacceptable.
201105,62,62901,2246,NA,NA,22.3.1 Le Bloc Québécois exhorte le gouvernement fédéral à accorder aux ONG un financement prévisible et à long terme.
201105,62,62901,2247,NA,NA,"De plus, le gouvernement doit assurer l'indépendance de ces ONG : il ne revient pas à la société civile de défendre la politique du gouvernement."
201105,62,62901,2249,NA,NA,"Le 23 février 2009, Le gouvernement conservateur a annoncé qu'il allait concentrer son aide bilatérale dans 20 pays prioritaires."
201105,62,62901,2250,NA,NA,"Cela vient changer la liste des pays prioritaires qui avait été mise en place par le gouvernement de Paul Martin, en 2005, lorsque 25 pays avaient été ciblés."
201105,62,62901,2251,NA,NA,"En modifiant cette liste, le gouvernement conservateur cesse de prioriser l'Afrique."
201105,62,62901,2252,NA,NA,"En effet, huit pays africains ont été rayés de la liste prioritaire, dont le Rwanda, le Niger, le Burkina Faso et le Bénin."
201105,62,62901,2253,NA,NA,"Comparativement à la liste de 2005 qui comportait 14 pays africains, la liste de 200Ç n'en contient que sept."
201105,62,62901,2254,NA,NA,"De plus, le gouvernement fédéral réduit de moitié le nombre des pays de la Francophonie qui bénéficieront de l'aide bilatérale du Canada."
201105,62,62901,2255,NA,NA,"La liste de 2005 comportait dix pays membres de la Francophonie, alors que la liste de 200Ç ne contient que cinq pays membres."
201105,62,62901,2256,NA,NA,"Considérant les liens linguistiques et culturels qui unissent ces pays francophones au Québec et au Canada, le geste du gouvernement conservateur démontre son peu de considération à l'égard des francophones d'ici et d'ailleurs."
201105,62,62901,2257,NA,NA,"Parmi les nouveaux pays ajoutés à la liste, certains sont mieux nantis que les pays africains retirés."
201105,62,62901,2258,NA,NA,"On y note l'Ukraine, la Colombie, le Pérou, le Pakistan et l'Indonésie."
201105,62,62901,2259,NA,NA,"Selon les indicateurs de pauvreté, la liste de 2005 comportait plus de pays pauvres que la liste de 200Ç."
201105,62,62901,2260,NA,NA,22.4.1  Le Bloc Québécois exhorte le gouvernement fédéral à revoir sa liste des pays prioritaires afin de ne pas laisser tomber les pays africains et francophones.
201105,62,62901,2261,NA,NA,L'ouverture au commerce et la création de règles internationales pour contrer le protectionnisme et protéger les investissements sont de bonnes choses auxquelles le Bloc Québécois adhère.
201105,62,62901,2262,NA,NA,"Cela ne signifie pas que les règles commerciales doivent remettre en cause la capacité des États à redistribuer la richesse, à protéger l'environnement et la culture et assurer à leurs citoyennes et citoyens des services publics fondamentaux comme la santé et l'éducation."
201105,62,62901,2263,NA,NA,"Le cours actuel de la mondialisation, qui est un phénomène porteur de grandes espérances, mais aussi de grandes injustices, doit être infléchi."
201105,62,62901,2265,NA,NA,Le Québec est une nation commerçante.
201105,62,62901,2266,NA,NA,Les exportations internationales et interprovinciales du Québec représentent 51 % de son PIB.
201105,62,62901,2267,NA,NA,"Nos entreprises, en particulier nos entreprises de pointe ne pourraient survivre sur le marché intérieur."
201105,62,62901,2268,NA,NA,Une position protectionniste serait contraire à nos intérêts.
201105,62,62901,2269,NA,NA,"C'est la raison pour laquelle le Québec, et en particulier les souverainistes québécois, ont massivement approuvé l'accord de libre-échange avec les États-Unis puis l'ALÉNA et que le Bloc Québécois a été le premier parti à demander une entente de libre-échange avec l'Union européenne."
201105,62,62901,2270,NA,NA,"Or, l'environnement commercial s'est considérablement détérioré ces dernières années."
201105,62,62901,2271,NA,NA,"Entre 2003 et 2009, le Québec est passé d'un important surplus commercial à un déficit commercial de 21 milliards de dollars13, lequel nous a aussi considérablement appauvris et a affaibli notre secteur manufacturier."
201105,62,62901,2272,NA,NA,La libéralisation des échanges ne peut être profitable que si elle est balisée par certaines règles.
201105,62,62901,2273,NA,NA,"Autrement, elle n'est qu'une course vers le bas."
201105,62,62901,2274,NA,NA,"Longtemps, la politique commerciale canadienne n'a visé qu'à accroître l'accès aux marchés étrangers."
201105,62,62901,2275,NA,NA,"De ce point de vue, elle a été un grand succès."
201105,62,62901,2276,NA,NA,"Aujourd'hui, la majorité des produits représentant environ 85 % du commerce mondial, circulent librement."
201105,62,62901,2277,NA,NA,"Mais nous sommes maintenant à même de constater certains effets pervers de cette libéralisation débridée : pressions extrêmes sur notre industrie, délocalisations à rabais, accords commerciaux qui sont autant d'encouragements à aller exploiter les populations et l'environnement dans les pays en développement."
201105,62,62901,2278,NA,NA,"L'environnement commercial a changé ces dernières années et, en ce qui concerne le Québec, ce n'est pas pour le mieux."
201105,62,62901,2279,NA,NA,23.1.1 Le Bloc Québécois propose un changement dans les priorités commerciales du Canada.
201105,62,62901,2280,NA,NA,"Après la libéralisation des échanges, le Canada doit maintenant se concentrer sur l'établissement de règles permettant des échanges plus équitables."
201105,62,62901,2282,NA,NA,Un système commercial qui engendre l'exploitation dans les pays pauvres et le dumping dans [es pays riches n'est pas viable.
201105,62,62901,2283,NA,NA,"L'absence de standards en matière d'environnement ou de droit du travail dans les accords commerciaux exerce une pression énorme sur nos industries, particulièrement nos industries traditionnelles."
201105,62,62901,2284,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois estime que le travail des enfants, le travail forcé et le déni des droits fondamentaux des travailleuses et des travailleurs constituent une forme de concurrence déloyale, au même titre, voire davantage, que les subventions à l'exportation ou le dumping."
201105,62,62901,2285,NA,NA,"L'interdiction de ces pratiques est largement acceptée à l'échelle internationale, comme en témoigne l'important niveau d'adhésion aux huit conventions fondamentales de l'Organisation internationale du travail."
201105,62,62901,2286,NA,NA,Il faut avoir le moyen de se protéger contre ces pratiques.
201105,62,62901,2287,NA,NA,"Or, les accords commerciaux et les lois commerciales ne permettent pas de protéger nos entreprises et nos travailleurs contre ce dumping social."
201105,62,62901,2288,NA,NA,"Si un pays veut profiter des avantages du libre-échange, il devrait en contrepartie accepter un certain nombre de règles de base notamment dans le domaine des droits sociaux."
201105,62,62901,2289,NA,NA,"Le Québec, où les industries menacées par la concurrence asiatique sont proportionnellement beaucoup plus présentes qu'au Canada, est en avance dans ce débat."
201105,62,62901,2290,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois presse le gouvernement fédéral de réviser ses positions dans les négociations commerciales pour faire en sorte d'inclure dans les accords commerciaux des clauses prévoyant le respect des accords internationaux relatifs aux droits fondamentaux du travail, de la personne et du respect de l'environnement."
201105,62,62901,2291,NA,NA,"Le Bloc Québécois considère que le Canada, pour être crédible sur cette question, doit rapidement adhérer aux grandes conventions de l'Organisation internationale du travail contre les discriminations, le travail forcé et le travail des enfants, pour le droit d'association syndicale et la libre négociation et qu'il contraigne les entreprises canadiennes oeuvrant à l'étranger de respecter les mêmes principes des dites conventions."
201105,62,62901,2293,NA,NA,Seules les entreprises peuvent actuellement déposer des plaintes au Tribunal canadien du commerce extérieur.
201105,62,62901,2294,NA,NA,"Or, dans les cas de délocalisation, il arrive que nos usines ferment et que nos emplois se perdent parce qu'ils sont victimes de la concurrence déloyale provenant d'une entreprise canadienne présente à l'étranger."
201105,62,62901,2295,NA,NA,"En pareil cas, l'entreprise d'ici ne déposera évidemment pas de plainte; elle déposerait cette plainte contre elle-même."
201105,62,62901,2296,NA,NA,"Des pratiques déloyales, qui seraient considérées comme anticoncurrentielles et interdites si elles étaient pratiquées sur le marché canadien, deviennent ainsi tolérées lorsque le produit est fabriqué à l'étranger, tout simplement parce que les lois sont dépassées."
201105,62,62901,2297,NA,NA,"23.3.1 Le Bloc Québécois présentera des amendements aux lois commerciales pour permettre aux syndicats de déposer eux-mêmes des plaintes au Tribunal canadien du commerce extérieur, notamment pour faire face aux situations où l'entreprise n'en déposera pas parce qu'elle a délocalisé sa production à l'étranger."
201105,62,62901,2299,NA,NA,"Lorsque le Tribunal canadien du commerce extérieur constate que les entreprises subissent un dommage grave et sont menacées par des importations qui augmentent à une vitesse folle il autorise le gouvernement à les protéger temporairement (pour un maximum de cinq ans), le temps qu'elles se modernisent et qu'elles affrontent la concurrence étrangère."
201105,62,62901,2300,NA,NA,"Ces mesures prévues dans les accords commerciaux, s'appellent des mesures de sauvegarde."
201105,62,62901,2301,NA,NA,"Jusqu'à maintenant, chaque fois que le Tribunal du commerce a recommandé au gouvernement de prendre des mesures de sauvegarde pour donner aux industries un peu de temps pour s'adapter, le gouvernement fédéral a toujours refusé."
201105,62,62901,2302,NA,NA,"Dans tous les cas, il s'agissait d'entreprises fortement présentes au Québec, comme les bicyclettes, le textile ou le vêtement."
201105,62,62901,2303,NA,NA,23.4.1 Le Bloc Québécois pressera le gouvernement de respecter les décisions du Tribunal canadien du commerce extérieur lorsqu'il constate qu'un secteur industriel subit un dommage grave du fait des importations accrues et qu'il recommande de prendre des mesures de sauvegarde.
201105,62,62901,2305,NA,NA,"Si le projet de Zone de libre-échange des Amériques est sur la glace et que la ronde de Doha à l'OMC est moribonde, ce n'est pas parce que le système multilatéral est inefficace, mais bien parce que les bases de négociation sont mauvaises."
201105,62,62901,2306,NA,NA,Plusieurs pays semblent considérer que les concessions qu'on leur demande sont plus importantes que les bienfaits qu'ils espèrent tirer d'un éventuel accord.

201105,62,62901,2312,NA,NA,"GATT, puis l'OMC, ont sonné le glas des empires et probablement évité bien des guerres."
201105,62,62901,2313,NA,NA,C'est un gain énorme.
201105,62,62901,2314,NA,NA,Le temps est venu de corriger les effets pervers de la libéralisation du commerce et de veiller à ce que les échanges commerciaux soient source de progrès pour tous.
201105,62,62901,2315,NA,NA,"Or, un accord bilatéral de libre-échange avec un pays en particulier peut libéraliser davantage le commerce, mais il ne permet pas d'édicter des règles permettant de civiliser le commerce."
201105,62,62901,2316,NA,NA,Ce magnifique chantier ne peut s'accomplir qu'en contexte multilatéral.

200410,63,63320,47,NA,NA,That's the big difference in this campaign.
200410,63,63320,48,NA,NA,Mr Howard sees it as a lap of honour.
200410,63,63320,49,NA,NA,"I see it as an honour to serve, to muster all my passion and commitment for the long-term service of the Australian people."
200410,63,63320,50,NA,NA,"I say: if you truly love this country, if you truly respect its people, no one could run to be Prime Minister with anything less than a full commitment to the job."
200410,63,63320,51,NA,NA,I couldn't do it.
200410,63,63320,52,NA,NA,And I don't know how Mr Howard can claim to believe in Australia when he refuses to be honest and open with the Australian people themselves.
200410,63,63320,54,NA,NA,But perhaps we shouldn't be too hard on him.
200410,63,63320,55,NA,NA,"There is, of course, one promise Mr Howard has kept in full."
200410,63,63320,56,NA,NA,There's one goal he and his Coalition colleagues have pursued relentlessly for eight years - and that's the destruction of Medicare.
200410,63,63320,57,NA,NA,This has been one of the great ding-dong battles of Australian public life.
200410,63,63320,58,NA,NA,A battle of principle on health policy.
200410,63,63320,59,NA,NA,Labor investing in public health care.
200410,63,63320,60,NA,NA,The Coalition pursuing the privatisation of health - a system based on private insurance and private care.
200410,63,63320,61,NA,NA,Labor investing in one tier of quality health care for all Australians.
200410,63,63320,62,NA,NA,The Coalition preferring a two tier system - private health insurance for the top tier and a second class service for everyone else.
200410,63,63320,63,NA,NA,That's what they believe in.
200410,63,63320,64,NA,NA,Last year Mr Howard was asked about his preferred health policy.
200410,63,63320,65,NA,NA,And he said that he liked the system we had at the beginning of the 1970s.
200410,63,63320,66,NA,NA,None of us should forget what he was talking about.
200410,63,63320,67,NA,NA,That was a time when a large number of Australian families had no health insurance - public or private.
200410,63,63320,68,NA,NA,They had to make that terrible choice in life between food on the table and the health care of their children.
200410,63,63320,69,NA,NA,It's the reason why Labor Governments introduced Medibank and then Medicare - to provide a decent level of public health insurance for all Australians.
200410,63,63320,70,NA,NA,"A health system based on the medical needs of the patient, not the size of their bank account."
200410,63,63320,71,NA,NA,John Howard has opposed Medicare ever since.
200410,63,63320,72,NA,NA,When he first led the Liberal Party he said that he wanted to ''take a scalpel to Medicare''.
200410,63,63320,73,NA,NA,Last month his Deputy John Anderson said that country people wanted and needed a two-tier health system.
200410,63,63320,74,NA,NA,"Well, that's what this election is all about."
200410,63,63320,75,NA,NA,It's a referendum on the future of Medicare.
200410,63,63320,76,NA,NA,Do we want the Coalition to take us further down the American road of privatised health - a two tier system?
200410,63,63320,77,NA,NA,Do we want to give John Howard another chance to put his scalpel into Medicare?
200410,63,63320,78,NA,NA,Or do we want a Labor Government with a plan to save Medicare?
200410,63,63320,79,NA,NA,Just one tier.
200410,63,63320,80,NA,NA,One world-class health care system for all Australians.
200410,63,63320,81,NA,NA,"We set up this system, we're proud of it and we're going to bring it back to its full health."
200410,63,63320,82,NA,NA,Labor believes in Medicare.
200410,63,63320,83,NA,NA,It's good public policy.
200410,63,63320,84,NA,NA,"But it also says something special about who we are, about the things that make us uniquely Australian."
200410,63,63320,85,NA,NA,"It says that in our country, if you get sick then someone will care for you."
200410,63,63320,86,NA,NA,It says that the Australian people look out for each other.
200410,63,63320,87,NA,NA,That we help our mates and those in need.
200410,63,63320,88,NA,NA,No one gets left behind.
200410,63,63320,89,NA,NA,"No one gets left without decent hospital care, without the availability of a bulk-billing doctor."
200410,63,63320,90,NA,NA,That's what makes it Medicare.
200410,63,63320,91,NA,NA,And that's why Labor believes in it.
200410,63,63320,92,NA,NA,It's universal.
200410,63,63320,93,NA,NA,"It's for the many, not just the few."
200410,63,63320,94,NA,NA,The Liberals talk about a safety net.
200410,63,63320,95,NA,NA,But you don't need a safety net unless you've turned the health system into a highwire act and families are in danger of falling off.
200410,63,63320,96,NA,NA,Labor doesn't believe in a safety net.
200410,63,63320,97,NA,NA,We believe in Medicare.
200410,63,63320,98,NA,NA,"And we'll never surrender, we'll never give up on increasing the rate of bulk-billing."
200410,63,63320,99,NA,NA,We want to get it back to a national rate of 80 per cent.
200410,63,63320,100,NA,NA,That's why a Labor Government will: Immediately increase the patient rebate by $5 for every bulk- billed consultation;
200410,63,63320,101,NA,NA,"Provide incentive payments of up to $22,500 for doctors who reach bulk-billing targets;"
200410,63,63320,102,NA,NA,Introduce Medicare After-Hours - GP clinics and services that stretch well into the night;
200410,63,63320,103,NA,NA,And we'll train thousands of extra doctors and nurses around Australia.
200410,63,63320,104,NA,NA,"In communities where bulk-billing has collapsed, we'll provide Medicare Teams - salaried doctors and nurses to deliver bulk- billing services."
200410,63,63320,105,NA,NA,Labor will also work with the States to upgrade our public hospital system.
200410,63,63320,106,NA,NA,"When the Coalition finds an extra dollar in the budget, they spend it on private health."
200410,63,63320,107,NA,NA,"Labor's top priority is public health - investing in public hospitals, reducing out-of-pocket expenses and cutting waiting lists."
200410,63,63320,108,NA,NA,The Howard Government has taken almost a billion dollars out of public hospital funding to the States.
200410,63,63320,109,NA,NA,Labor will put it back in.
200410,63,63320,110,NA,NA,"We'll invest an extra $350 million in capital improvements for emergency departments - clearing the backlog, getting the patients off trolleys and into hospital beds."
200410,63,63320,111,NA,NA,"We'll also provide an extra 2.4 million specialist treatments for outpatients in public hospitals, free-of-charge."
200410,63,63320,112,NA,NA,This is Labor's vision for the health system.
200410,63,63320,113,NA,NA,Families who can find a bulk-billing doctor.
200410,63,63320,114,NA,NA,"Patients who move quickly through emergency departments and then have available to them the best doctors, nurses and medical technology - services free-of-charge in public hospitals."
200410,63,63320,115,NA,NA,Quality health care for all.
200410,63,63320,117,NA,NA,"To make this vision real, we always need to do more."
200410,63,63320,118,NA,NA,Mr Howard is waging war on Medicare.
200410,63,63320,119,NA,NA,I want to build a fortress around it.
200410,63,63320,120,NA,NA,"In particular, we must do more for our senior citizens."
200410,63,63320,121,NA,NA,I can't stomach a system where elderly Australians are left on hospital waiting lists for long periods of time.
200410,63,63320,122,NA,NA,Our senior citizens have served this country well.
200410,63,63320,123,NA,NA,They've defended it during times of war.
200410,63,63320,124,NA,NA,They've won peace and built our prosperity.
200410,63,63320,125,NA,NA,"The measure of our civilisation, the test for Australians of my generation, is how we treat them in return."
200410,63,63320,126,NA,NA,"You know, I'm part of the lucky generation."
200410,63,63320,127,NA,NA,We've fought no world wars.
200410,63,63320,128,NA,NA,We've seen no depressions.
200410,63,63320,129,NA,NA,We've enjoyed a national dividend of peace and prosperity secured by older Australians.
200410,63,63320,130,NA,NA,"Surely now, it's time to say thank you."
200410,63,63320,131,NA,NA,And to treat our senior citizens as they have treated us.
200410,63,63320,132,NA,NA,With honour and respect.
200410,63,63320,133,NA,NA,And the best way of honouring their service to Australia is to give them the world's best health system.
200410,63,63320,134,NA,NA,To get them off waiting lists and into hospital beds as quickly as possible.
200410,63,63320,135,NA,NA,Today I can announce the greatest extension in Federal responsibility for hospital care in this country since the introduction of Medibank 30 years ago.
200410,63,63320,136,NA,NA,A Federal Labor Government will take full responsibility for the hospital costs of Australians aged 75 and over.
200410,63,63320,137,NA,NA,We will ensure that they can access a hospital bed - public or private - straight away.
200410,63,63320,138,NA,NA,No more delays.
200410,63,63320,139,NA,NA,No more waiting lists for our oldest Australians.
200410,63,63320,140,NA,NA,This is an important extension of the universal coverage of Medicare.
200410,63,63320,141,NA,NA,We call it Medicare Gold.
200410,63,63320,142,NA,NA,"In some parts of Australia, our senior citizens can wait up to 12 months for hip, knee and eye operations."
200410,63,63320,143,NA,NA,Medicare Gold will give them a hospital bed straight away.
200410,63,63320,144,NA,NA,Public hospitals will receive additional funding to improve the services they provide for Australians aged over 75.
200410,63,63320,145,NA,NA,"Labor will also pay for private hospital beds, under agreements finalised with the private hospital system."
200410,63,63320,146,NA,NA,"As a result, senior Australians will no longer need to take out private health insurance for hospital care."
200410,63,63320,147,NA,NA,The costs will be covered by a Federal Labor Government.
200410,63,63320,148,NA,NA,Medicare Gold is a great advance for our national health system.
200410,63,63320,149,NA,NA,"It ends the old, inefficient divide between public versus private hospitals and Commonwealth versus State funding."
200410,63,63320,150,NA,NA,It will also deliver significant benefits for Australians under 75 - taking the pressure off public hospitals and reducing the cost of private health insurance.
200410,63,63320,151,NA,NA,"People aged 75 and over make up five per cent of the private insurance pool, but account for 23 per cent of hospital benefits paid out by the private funds."
200410,63,63320,152,NA,NA,"Under Medicare Gold, these costs will be met by the Commonwealth, allowing the funds to reduce their hospital insurance premiums by at least 12 per cent."
200410,63,63320,153,NA,NA,Labor will regulate to ensure these savings are passed onto the public.
200410,63,63320,154,NA,NA,That's the advantage of Medicare Gold:
200410,63,63320,155,NA,NA,Extending Medicare into universal hospital coverage - public and private - for Australians aged 75 and over.
200410,63,63320,156,NA,NA,Reducing hospital waiting lists for all age groups.
200410,63,63320,157,NA,NA,And providing better value for money with private hospital insurance - savings of more than 12 per cent.
200410,63,63320,158,NA,NA,It's a gold-plated Medicare system - Medicare Gold.
200410,63,63320,159,NA,NA,And only a Labor Government will deliver it.
200410,63,63320,161,NA,NA,There's another waiting list we must also confront.
200410,63,63320,162,NA,NA,Another service we must provide to our senior citizens.
200410,63,63320,163,NA,NA,"Currently there are more than 500,000 Australians, most of them elderly, waiting for months and years, just to have their teeth fixed."
200410,63,63320,164,NA,NA,Mr Howard axed the previous Federal program and said that the States had to look after dental care.
200410,63,63320,165,NA,NA,"I say: it's a national responsibility,"
200410,63,63320,166,NA,NA,part of the care and consideration we owe our senior Australians.
200410,63,63320,167,NA,NA,That's why a Labor Government will create a national dental program: a $300 million investment with an extra 1.3 million dental treatments for aged pensioners and health card holders.
200410,63,63320,168,NA,NA,This will clear away the existing backlog and give our senior citizens what they deserve: the care of a civilised society in getting their teeth fixed up.
200410,63,63320,169,NA,NA,They've served our country well.
200410,63,63320,170,NA,NA,"Now we must honour and serve their needs, through Medicare Gold and a national dental program."
200410,63,63320,172,NA,NA,When I became Labor Leader I said that I would listen to the Australian people.
200410,63,63320,173,NA,NA,I said that I would open up the political process - a new politics of community forums and consultation.
200410,63,63320,174,NA,NA,"I promised to reform politicians' entitlements, starting with the parliamentary superannuation scheme."
200410,63,63320,175,NA,NA,And I delivered.
200410,63,63320,176,NA,NA,Many of the people coming to our community forums have been senior Australians.
200410,63,63320,177,NA,NA,Age pensioners have told me how they're struggling financially under the Howard Government.
200410,63,63320,178,NA,NA,"Their incomes are fixed, but the cost of living keeps on rising - with higher health costs, bank fees and the impact of the GST."
200410,63,63320,179,NA,NA,They're frustrated that the government only adjusts their pension twice a year.
200410,63,63320,180,NA,NA,I say: six months is too long to wait for assistance.
200410,63,63320,181,NA,NA,It's too long to wait for a cost of living increase in the pension.
200410,63,63320,182,NA,NA,I've listened to these concerns and now I want to deliver a solution.
200410,63,63320,183,NA,NA,A Labor Government will increase the pension four times a year.
200410,63,63320,184,NA,NA,"We'll introduce quarterly indexation - increases in June and December, in addition to March and September."
200410,63,63320,185,NA,NA,"These new arrangements will start on June 20 next year, with an increase in the fortnightly pension of around $5 for singles and $8 for couples."
200410,63,63320,186,NA,NA,The cost of living doesn't stand still for six months between pension increases.
200410,63,63320,187,NA,NA,The pension shouldn't be frozen either.
200410,63,63320,188,NA,NA,Labor will index it every quarter.
200410,63,63320,189,NA,NA,We'll ease the financial pressure on Australia's pensioners.
200410,63,63320,190,NA,NA,"Our policy will benefit Age Pensioners, DVA Service Pensioners, Carer Pensioners, Disability Pensioners, Sole Parent Pensioners, Wife and Widow Pensioners."
200410,63,63320,191,NA,NA,There's another group of senior Australians who have been coming to my community forums.
200410,63,63320,192,NA,NA,"They're grandparents who, late in life, have taken care and custody of their grandchildren."
200410,63,63320,193,NA,NA,"Having moved into retirement, they now face the renewed challenge of raising young children - with all the costs and pressure this involves."
200410,63,63320,194,NA,NA,These grandparents deserve our support.
200410,63,63320,195,NA,NA,They're providing love and devotion to children in need.
200410,63,63320,196,NA,NA,The Australian Government needs to provide them with new forms of financial support.
200410,63,63320,197,NA,NA,"Today I can announce that Labor will introduce a new Grandparenting Allowance, worth $20 per week for each child."
200410,63,63320,198,NA,NA,"This will benefit over 27,000 grandparents around Australia who have primary care of their grandchildren."
200410,63,63320,199,NA,NA,And I say: they deserve every cent of it.
200410,63,63320,200,NA,NA,They're unsung heroes in our society.
200410,63,63320,201,NA,NA,This is one of the great goals of Labor's campaign: lifting the financial pressure on the families and senior Australians doing it tough.
200410,63,63320,202,NA,NA,"Just four months ago, on Budget night, these were the forgotten Australians:"
200410,63,63320,203,NA,NA,"The hard workers on 30, 40 and 50 thousand dollars a year who missed out on a tax cut."
200410,63,63320,204,NA,NA,The pensioners and self-funded retirees who were also ignored.
200410,63,63320,205,NA,NA,"Well, Labor hasn't forgotten them."
200410,63,63320,206,NA,NA,Our Tax and Family Plan will ease the squeeze on middle Australia.
200410,63,63320,207,NA,NA,It will put incentive and reward for effort back into the Australian economy.
200410,63,63320,208,NA,NA,"Under Labor all those Australian taxpayers earning under $52,000 a year (including self-funded retirees) will get a tax cut of up to $8 a week - $416 a year."
200410,63,63320,209,NA,NA,"With the rising cost of buying a home and raising a family, people earning over $80,000 a year also need incentive."
200410,63,63320,210,NA,NA,That's why Labor will lift the threshold for the top marginal tax rate.
200410,63,63320,211,NA,NA,Plus we'll help families with a better family payments system.
200410,63,63320,212,NA,NA,"Combining payments into one, simpler scheme and raising the point at which the means test starts from $33,000 to $50,000."
200410,63,63320,213,NA,NA,"For a typical middle Australian family, this means an extra $70-80 a week."
200410,63,63320,214,NA,NA,We'll also overcome the family debt crisis which has harmed 1.4 million Australian families.
200410,63,63320,215,NA,NA,We'll end the nightmare of having to haggle with Centrelink about undeserved debts to the government.
200410,63,63320,216,NA,NA,And a Labor Government will introduce income splitting for the benefit of single income couples - two tax free thresholds to help families where one partner stays at home.
200410,63,63320,217,NA,NA,For 30 years Mr Howard has been talking about income splitting.
200410,63,63320,218,NA,NA,"But now, only Labor will deliver."
200410,63,63320,219,NA,NA,"For the disadvantaged, our plan offers new opportunities in life."
200410,63,63320,220,NA,NA,"We need to confront the problem of 800,000 Australian children growing up in jobless households."
200410,63,63320,221,NA,NA,"We know what this leads to: poverty, poor health, increased crime rates and, worst of all, lack of hope."
200410,63,63320,222,NA,NA,This is the national shame we face as citizens under the Howard Government.
200410,63,63320,223,NA,NA,"There are three answers to this problem: participation, participation and more participation."
200410,63,63320,224,NA,NA,"By offering incentive and services, we can bring more people into the labour market,"
200410,63,63320,225,NA,NA,and give our young people the best example they need in life - parents who work.
200410,63,63320,226,NA,NA,"So if you want to know what our tax policy means in one line, it's this: fairness,"
200410,63,63320,227,NA,NA,aspiration
200410,63,63320,228,NA,NA,and participation.
200410,63,63320,229,NA,NA,A fairer go for Australian families.
200410,63,63320,230,NA,NA,Our plans for the nation are fully costed and fully funded.
200410,63,63320,231,NA,NA,We're the only party in this campaign that's been making budget savings.
200410,63,63320,232,NA,NA,The only party willing to respect the budget surplus.
200410,63,63320,233,NA,NA,The only party putting downward pressure on interest rates.
200410,63,63320,234,NA,NA,"For me, that's not just a policy."
200410,63,63320,235,NA,NA,It's a personal commitment.
200410,63,63320,236,NA,NA,"Janine and I have got a great, big mortgage."
200410,63,63320,237,NA,NA,We live in a mortgage belt street.
200410,63,63320,238,NA,NA,We come from a mortgage belt community.
200410,63,63320,239,NA,NA,"We know the importance of responsible economic management, of keeping interest rates low."
200410,63,63320,240,NA,NA,The Howard-Costello Government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history.
200410,63,63320,241,NA,NA,There is no shortage of funds flowing into Canberra.
200410,63,63320,242,NA,NA,"Our task is to make better use of this money: to cut waste and mismanagement, to reorder priorities."
200410,63,63320,243,NA,NA,And that's what Labor has been doing.
200410,63,63320,244,NA,NA,"So far, we have identified more than $27 billion in savings, with another half-a-billion announced this morning."
200410,63,63320,245,NA,NA,Responsible economic management.
200410,63,63320,246,NA,NA,Budgets are about choices.
200410,63,63320,247,NA,NA,And Labor's choice is to cut bureaucracy and wasteful spending to make way for our investments in education and health.
200410,63,63320,248,NA,NA,That's our priority: cutting at the centre of government and delivering new programs and opportunities for families and communities on the edge.
200410,63,63320,249,NA,NA,"It's good economic policy,"
200410,63,63320,250,NA,NA,and it's good for the fairness of our society.
200410,63,63320,252,NA,NA,There's another area where the Howard Government has followed a user pays approach - the education of our children.
200410,63,63320,253,NA,NA,The Liberals and Nationals always run down the education system. Always.
200410,63,63320,254,NA,NA,It's only Labor that believes in opportunity for all.
200410,63,63320,255,NA,NA,And sees education as the greatest of all opportunities.
200410,63,63320,256,NA,NA,We believe in the next generation of young Australians.
200410,63,63320,257,NA,NA,And a Labor Government will invest in their future.
200410,63,63320,258,NA,NA,"Reading books to our infant children - building literacy when it really matters, early in life."
200410,63,63320,259,NA,NA,Plus we'll extend the principles of public education into our child care and preschool systems:
200410,63,63320,260,NA,NA,A free day of learning for three and four year olds.
200410,63,63320,261,NA,NA,Something more than child minding - early childhood development.
200410,63,63320,262,NA,NA,"And when our children go to school, we need to give them a fair funding system."
200410,63,63320,263,NA,NA,So that every Australian school can be a high-achievement school.
200410,63,63320,264,NA,NA,"You know, I'm a very different person to Mr Howard."
200410,63,63320,265,NA,NA,But the biggest difference is this.
200410,63,63320,266,NA,NA,"He sees a school like Kings in Sydney, with its vast resources, its boat shed and its rifle range, and he says: ''that's the sort of school that needs a 200% funding increase''."
200410,63,63320,267,NA,NA,I see schools in this country that haven't even got libraries or computers.
200410,63,63320,268,NA,NA,"And my response: engage in any debate, take on any political fight, do whatever it takes to give these schools a fair share of funding."
200410,63,63320,269,NA,NA,Give them a library - books to read and computers to use.
200410,63,63320,270,NA,NA,Give these students a life full of opportunity and social justice.
200410,63,63320,271,NA,NA,"For me, it doesn't matter whether they are government or non- government schools."
200410,63,63320,272,NA,NA,"Our policy is about the fair funding of schools, not who runs them."
200410,63,63320,273,NA,NA,"Under Labor's new system, all schools will be funded on the basis of need."
200410,63,63320,274,NA,NA,We will bring every Australian school up to a high national standard of resources and achievement.
200410,63,63320,275,NA,NA,"The overall funding level for non-government schools will be maintained,"
200410,63,63320,276,NA,NA,but with a fairer pattern of distribution.
200410,63,63320,277,NA,NA,"Needy Catholic, Christian and Independent schools will receive an extra $520 million, at the expense of wealthy schools like Kings and Geelong Grammar."
200410,63,63320,278,NA,NA,Labor will also provide an extra $1.9 billion for government schools - lifting them up to our national standard of resources and results.
200410,63,63320,279,NA,NA,"For the most disadvantaged parts of our society, they have one great hope in life: the neighbourhood government school at the end of their street."
200410,63,63320,280,NA,NA,It's their passport out of poverty.
200410,63,63320,281,NA,NA,"As Prime Minister, I won't rest until that hope is fulfilled."
200410,63,63320,282,NA,NA,"Until we can give every parent - not just some, but every parent - the most important guarantee and choice in life: no matter where they send their children, they will find a quality education."
200410,63,63320,283,NA,NA,"Under Labor's plan, 19 out of 20 students will be better off - increased funding for 9,500 schools."
200410,63,63320,284,NA,NA,That's what I call equity in action.
200410,63,63320,285,NA,NA,"And at the end of the school years, I don't want any talented child who has worked hard and studied hard to have to pause for a moment to see if they can afford a higher education."
200410,63,63320,286,NA,NA,"It goes against the great Australian principle that rewards in life should flow from talent and hard work, not your bank balance."
200410,63,63320,287,NA,NA,"That's why Labor will create 20,000 new university places and 20,000 new TAFE places, without the need for higher fees and student debt."
200410,63,63320,288,NA,NA,"Before the last election, Mr Howard denied he was planning to create $100,000 degrees."
200410,63,63320,289,NA,NA,Now there are nearly 50 courses that cost that much.
200410,63,63320,290,NA,NA,"You know, it must have been a non-core promise."
200410,63,63320,291,NA,NA,"There will be no $100,000 university degrees under Labor."
200410,63,63320,292,NA,NA,We'll stop the Howard Government's 25 per cent increase in HECS and abolish its full-fee system.
200410,63,63320,293,NA,NA,"And my fellow Australians, let's not forget that the skills and quality of our society relies on more than a good education system."
200410,63,63320,294,NA,NA,"It relies on the quality of all our public institutions, especially our national public broadcaster."
200410,63,63320,295,NA,NA,"That's why Labor will restore the independence of the ABC,"
200410,63,63320,296,NA,NA,and restore its funding - an extra $105 million.
200410,63,63320,297,NA,NA,"Plus, we'll run Australia's telecommunications system in the public interest."
200410,63,63320,298,NA,NA,That means keeping Telstra in majority public ownership.
200410,63,63320,299,NA,NA,There'll be no Telstra privatisation on my watch.
200410,63,63320,301,NA,NA,"And as we look to the future of our children, let's not forget the greatest intergenerational challenge of them all - saving our planet."
200410,63,63320,302,NA,NA,Australia must play a role in the international struggle against global warming.
200410,63,63320,303,NA,NA,Our national icons are at stake:
200410,63,63320,304,NA,NA,The coral bleaching and destruction of the Great Barrier Reef.
200410,63,63320,305,NA,NA,The flooding of Kakadu National Park with salt water.
200410,63,63320,306,NA,NA,No responsible leader could stand by and watch these things happen.
200410,63,63320,307,NA,NA,That's why Labor will ratify the Kyoto Protocol
200410,63,63320,308,NA,NA,and establish a carbon trading regime.
200410,63,63320,309,NA,NA,We need to be part of the lucrative international trade in carbon emissions.
200410,63,63320,310,NA,NA,It's good for the environment and good for the economy.
200410,63,63320,311,NA,NA,"In this campaign, Labor is the party of sustainable development:"
200410,63,63320,312,NA,NA,Increasing the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target from two to five per cent - giving clean industries like solar and wind power a future in this country.
200410,63,63320,313,NA,NA,"Investing $1 billion to save the grand old river system, the Murray/Darling, with improved water efficiency and water flows."
200410,63,63320,314,NA,NA,"And our commitment to halt land clearing, to protect our beaches and coastline and to lock away forever our greatest rainforest, the Daintree."
200410,63,63320,315,NA,NA,"In the coming days of this campaign, I'll also be announcing Labor's plan to save the mighty Tasmanian forests, conserving one of our greatest natural assets for future generations."
200410,63,63320,317,NA,NA,"Two days before this election, there's an historic anniversary: 7th October 1941, when John Curtin became Australia's Prime Minister."
200410,63,63320,318,NA,NA,"Curtin's priority was the Defence of Australia - securing our country, in our part of the world."
200410,63,63320,319,NA,NA,"In putting Australia first, he had to stand up not only to Winston Churchill but President Roosevelt as well."
200410,63,63320,320,NA,NA,"But that didn't stop John Curtin building a new alliance, a new partnership with the United States."
200410,63,63320,321,NA,NA,And he built that partnership on the only worthwhile basis - mutual respect between two sovereign and independent people.
200410,63,63320,322,NA,NA,The Alliance is not the property of any Australian party or any particular American administration.
200410,63,63320,323,NA,NA,It belongs to our two great peoples.
200410,63,63320,324,NA,NA,I want to render the United States the best service any Australian Prime Minister ever could.
200410,63,63320,325,NA,NA,"And that is to help the United States develop its true role of world leadership, based on respect, understanding and the cooperation demonstrated so powerfully after September 11, but undermined so tragically by the mistakes in Iraq."
200410,63,63320,326,NA,NA,"Most of all, the impact of those mistakes in our region."
200410,63,63320,327,NA,NA,"When Mr Howard sent Australian troops to the war in Iraq he knew, on advice, that his decision would make Australia less safe in the war against terror."
200410,63,63320,328,NA,NA,Now he says that he'll keep Australian troops in Iraq until they have finished the job.
200410,63,63320,329,NA,NA,But he can't tell them what the job is.
200410,63,63320,330,NA,NA,"The real job for Australia is in our region,"
200410,63,63320,331,NA,NA,working with our neighbours and with the United States.
200410,63,63320,332,NA,NA,"And as Prime Minister, I'll sign up for that job, for as long as it takes."
200410,63,63320,333,NA,NA,"This is where our permanent interests lie, not on the other side of the world."
200410,63,63320,334,NA,NA,"This is where Labor will dedicate our resources in the war against terror - to our region, to our part of the world, to the real security of the Australian people."
200410,63,63320,336,NA,NA,"My fellow Australians, Labor's plan for Australia's future draws its strength from four great sources: From the voice of the people themselves."
200410,63,63320,337,NA,NA,From the hard work of the Labor team I am honoured to lead.
200410,63,63320,338,NA,NA,From my pride in Labor's historic achievements for Australia.
200410,63,63320,339,NA,NA,And from my deepest convictions about a better way ahead for the country I love.
200410,63,63320,340,NA,NA,"And those convictions, in turn, come from my community, the people who believe in me and my work, the people who have given me so much help, every step along the way."
200410,63,63320,341,NA,NA,"When I was young, my mother taught me to believe in ambition and aspiration."
200410,63,63320,342,NA,NA,"She gave me the best advice of all: study hard, work hard and live your life in the service of others."
200410,63,63320,343,NA,NA,The community I grew up in taught me to believe in Australia and the possibilities of progress.
200410,63,63320,344,NA,NA,"A place called Green Valley gave me a passion, a belief in opportunity for all."
200410,63,63320,345,NA,NA,"And now in my life and in my home, Janine and the boys have taught me the power of caring, of our love and time together."
200410,63,63320,346,NA,NA,They have made me a better man.
200410,63,63320,347,NA,NA,A man strong enough to know that he can lead this nation well.
200410,63,63320,348,NA,NA,"That he can unite our people, not divide them."
200410,63,63320,349,NA,NA,That at 43 years of age - in the prime of my life - I have something to offer our country: the beliefs and values of a good society.
200410,63,63320,350,NA,NA,That's the Australia I believe in:
200410,63,63320,351,2,1,"No matter where you come from, you should have the same chance to succeed in life."
200410,63,63320,352,NA,NA,"A society where we look out for each other, not just ourselves."
200410,63,63320,353,NA,NA,"And if someone falls, we pick them up and give them a second chance in life."
200410,63,63320,354,NA,NA,No one gets left behind.
200410,63,63320,355,NA,NA,I believe in governments helping people.
200410,63,63320,356,NA,NA,I believe in opportunity.
200410,63,63320,357,NA,NA,"But I also know that the people should be enabled to help themselves - to work hard, to exercise responsibility."
200410,63,63320,358,NA,NA,"There is no way out of poverty and disadvantage without having a go, without effort."
200410,63,63320,359,NA,NA,"I want to lead a government that will free up the Australian people to have a go, by giving them all a fair-go."
200410,63,63320,360,NA,NA,This is what I mean by the ladder of opportunity - all Australians climbing upwards.
200410,63,63320,361,NA,NA,"Making a better life for themselves and their families,"
200410,63,63320,362,NA,NA,"knowing that at the same time, they are making Australia stronger and fairer."
200410,63,63320,363,NA,NA,Only in this way can we end the drift into division and ever- widening inequality.
200410,63,63320,364,NA,NA,"Only in this way can we restore a shared sense of purpose, every Australian participating in the life, work and future of the nation."
200410,63,63320,365,NA,NA,"Making Australia truly prosperous and secure,"
200410,63,63320,366,NA,NA,"no longer growing apart, but growing together."
200410,63,63320,367,NA,NA,"My fellow Australians, Australia needs, and needs now, a new government."
200410,63,63320,368,NA,NA,A government with optimism and energy:
200410,63,63320,369,NA,NA,"A government, a Prime Minister with fire in the belly."
200410,63,63320,370,NA,NA,A Prime Minister in touch with the Australian people.
200410,63,63320,371,NA,NA,A leader who believes in the people and always trusts in them.
200410,63,63320,372,NA,NA,That's Labor's goal - to give this nation a government every bit as fair and warm-hearted as the Australian people themselves.
200410,63,63320,373,NA,NA,A government as big and generous in spirit as the country we love.
200410,63,63320,374,NA,NA,"A government with the plans, the leadership, the will and the energy to take Australia forward."
200410,63,63320,375,NA,NA,"A government for the people, not just the powerful."
200410,63,63320,376,NA,NA,"A government that cares about the needy, the sick and the frail."
200410,63,63320,377,NA,NA,A government that gives real life expression to the great Australian ethos of a fair go for all.
200410,63,63320,378,NA,NA,"A government for the many, not just the few."
200410,63,63320,379,NA,NA,"That's why I'm asking for the support of the Australian people on the 9th October - to achieve these goals: our mighty crusade for a stronger, safer and fairer Australia, through the election of an Australian Labor Government."
200410,63,63620,8,NA,NA,Eight and a half years ago it became my immense privilege and honour to become the Prime Minister of this wonderful country of ours.
200410,63,63620,9,NA,NA,"And over the eight and a half years, I have shared the hopes and aspirations and the dreams and the achievements of my fellow Australians."
200410,63,63620,10,NA,NA,I have tried to feel the pain and the grief of those of my fellow Australians left saddened through the loss of loved ones in tragedies such as the murder of 35 people at Port Arthur and the terrible deaths of 88 fellow Australians during the Bali attack and other disasters.
200410,63,63620,11,NA,NA,"I have tried to understand and feel for the plight of struggling farmers, year after year gripped by drought, an undeserved lot, and the pain of seeing their crops wither and their hopes denied."
200410,63,63620,12,NA,NA,"I’ve shared the exaltation that so many of us feel with the success not only of our sportsmen and women but also our scientists and our actors and our businessmen and women, who do Australia proud around the world."
200410,63,63620,13,NA,NA,"Every day has been a new experience for me, everyday has been a reminder to me of the great character and decency and special nature which is the Australian way."
200410,63,63620,14,NA,NA,Every day has reminded me of that unique blend of toughness and compassion which is in reality the real Australia.
200410,63,63620,15,NA,NA,"Yes, we can be tough and direct and laconic and resilient."
200410,63,63620,16,NA,NA,But when need arises we can be warm and embracing and outpouring and compassionate and care for those that need assistance.
200410,63,63620,17,NA,NA,"It has been a great experience, it has been a humbling experience."
200410,63,63620,18,NA,NA,It has been a journey to reinforce my values as an Australian.
200410,63,63620,19,NA,NA,"It has been a journey in which I’ve been accompanied by some wonderful colleagues and may I particularly mention the contribution along that journey of the Deputy Prime Minister, my friend, the leader of the National Party John Anderson."
200410,63,63620,20,NA,NA,And may I also mention the wonderful contribution that the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Treasurer for the last eight and a half years Peter Costello has made to that journey.
200410,63,63620,21,NA,NA,Without them and all of my other colleagues we would not have achieved what has been achieved over that last eight and a half years.
200410,63,63620,22,NA,NA,I’ve had the values of Australians reinforced over that time.
200410,63,63620,23,NA,NA,I’ve also learnt that they want certain things from their Government but there are some things they don’t want from their Government.
200410,63,63620,24,NA,NA,They want their Government to create a climate of stability and security and reassurance but they don’t want their Governments to tell them how to live their lives.
200410,63,63620,25,NA,NA,They don’t want a behavioural policeman as a Prime Minister.
200410,63,63620,26,NA,NA,They want a Prime Minister who understands them
200410,63,63620,27,NA,NA,and will let them get on with their lives
200410,63,63620,28,NA,NA,and will give them freedom and choice and opportunity.
200410,63,63620,29,NA,NA,"Like all elections, the election on the 9th of October is about a choice."
200410,63,63620,30,NA,NA,It’s about who can better secure Australia’s future as a nation.
200410,63,63620,31,NA,NA,It’s about who can better secure the future of Australian families.
200410,63,63620,32,NA,NA,When I called the election I asked a series of questions and they are as relevant today as they were then.
200410,63,63620,33,NA,NA,I said who do you better trust to keep living standards high and the economy strong?
200410,63,63620,34,NA,NA,Who do you better trust to keep your interest rates low?
200410,63,63620,35,NA,NA,Who do you better trust to lead Australia in the fight against the peril of international terrorism?
200410,63,63620,36,NA,NA,Who do you better trust to keep the budget strong and in surplus so that we can better afford to spend more on health and education and defence.
200410,63,63620,37,NA,NA,"They are the issues, they are the questions that the Australian people will ask"
200410,63,63620,38,NA,NA,and the answers are emphatic.
200410,63,63620,39,NA,NA,The journey of the last eight and a half years has involved many difficult decisions.
200410,63,63620,40,NA,NA,We inherited a $96 billion government debt.
200410,63,63620,41,NA,NA,We have repaid $73 billion of that.
200410,63,63620,42,NA,NA,I hear Mr Crean and Mr Latham saying that Labor Governments will stay in surplus.
200410,63,63620,43,NA,NA,"As Peter Costello frequently says, never listen to what Labor says, remember what Labor did."
200410,63,63620,44,NA,NA,The last five Labor budgets alone produced cumulative deficits of $70 billion.
200410,63,63620,45,NA,NA,"So the last time they had a go at getting a budget in surplus, they had five goes at it and they were in deficit each time and the total deficit was $70 billion."
200410,63,63620,46,NA,NA,And they talk about taking pressure off interest rates in government.
200410,63,63620,47,NA,NA,Just remember what they did when they last had a go.
200410,63,63620,48,NA,NA,Over the last eight and a half years we have embraced many reforms.
200410,63,63620,49,NA,NA,We have reformed our industrial relations system.
200410,63,63620,50,NA,NA,In 1998 after years of hesitation we finally had a Government with the courage to take on the Maritime Union of Australia.
200410,63,63620,51,NA,NA,We broke the back of union power on the waterfront
200410,63,63620,52,NA,NA,"and the result has been higher productivity,"
200410,63,63620,53,NA,NA,and the produce of Australia’s hard-working farmers no longer rots on the wharves of Australia.
200410,63,63620,54,NA,NA,We have reformed the taxation system.
200410,63,63620,55,NA,NA,We have reformed the welfare system.
200410,63,63620,56,NA,NA,"When we brought in Work for the Dole, the Labor Party attacked it as a mickey mouse solution."
200410,63,63620,57,NA,NA,They now quietly claim that they are going to keep it.
200410,63,63620,58,NA,NA,"These reforms, most of which were tenaciously opposed by the Labor Party from the very beginning."
200410,63,63620,59,NA,NA,"Not only did they leave us with a huge deficit, they tried to stop us fixing it up."
200410,63,63620,60,NA,NA,"But now, of course, they’re very happy to help themselves to surpluses that they could never generate in Government."
200410,63,63620,61,NA,NA,Our reforms and our efforts have yielded great results.
200410,63,63620,62,NA,NA,Our interest rates are the lowest in 30 years.
200410,63,63620,63,NA,NA,Our taxes are lower.
200410,63,63620,64,NA,NA,Unemployment is lower.
200410,63,63620,65,NA,NA,Our wages are higher.
200410,63,63620,66,NA,NA,I have no prouder claim as Prime Minister than to say that over the last eight and a half years real wages in this country have risen by between 13 to 14 per cent
200410,63,63620,67,NA,NA,against a miserable 2.6 per cent in the 13 years of Labor Government.
200410,63,63620,68,NA,NA,The Coalition has been a better friend of the workers of Australia than Labor could ever dream of being.
200410,63,63620,69,NA,NA,"In 1996 there were 35 federal electorates in Australia that had double digit unemployment or worse, now there are only four."
200410,63,63620,70,NA,NA,These are the great human dividends of good economic policy.
200410,63,63620,71,NA,NA,"Running the economy well only has a purpose if it delivers a human dividend, if it delivers things for the Australian people."
200410,63,63620,72,NA,NA,That has been our goal and that has been the outcome of our economic policies.
200410,63,63620,73,NA,NA,Australia stands proud and tall around the world.
200410,63,63620,74,NA,NA,We are respected for what we have achieved with our economy.
200410,63,63620,75,NA,NA,We are seen as a nation prepared to take a stand on difficult international issues.
200410,63,63620,76,NA,NA,We are a true and trusted and reliable friend.
200410,63,63620,77,NA,NA,"When I became Prime Minister in 1996, I along with the other 20 million of my fellow Australians could not have imagined what lay ahead on the international scene."
200410,63,63620,78,NA,NA,We were not to know that the world would change forever on the 11th of September 2001
200410,63,63620,79,NA,NA,We could not foresee the terrible attack in Bali in 2002.
200410,63,63620,80,NA,NA,"We did not know that we would be called upon and proudly able to do, to liberate the people of East Timor, and in many ways fulfil a debt that this nation, particularly the generation of World War II, owed to the wonderful people of Timor."
200410,63,63620,81,NA,NA,"Terrorism has cast a dark cloud over the world, but it is a challenge that must be repulsed, and a challenge best repulsed by us being determined to live the lives of a free and democratic society."
200410,63,63620,82,NA,NA,"It will be a long fight and a difficult fight, and we must do it in cooperation with our friends all around the world, and most particularly here in our region."
200410,63,63620,83,NA,NA,"But whether popular or not, I will never hesitate to do what is right and necessary, whatever is right and necessary, to protect Australia and the Australian people against the threat of terrorism."
200410,63,63620,84,NA,NA,Our defence alliance with the United States is the cornerstone of our national security.
200410,63,63620,85,NA,NA,I support the American alliance because it is in Australia's national interest to do so.
200410,63,63620,86,NA,NA,We could never forget our history and we should understand the power realities of today.
200410,63,63620,87,NA,NA,"But we have demonstrated, despite what our critics predicted, that we have been able to build ever-closer ties with the United States"
200410,63,63620,88,NA,NA,and also grow closer to the nations of our region.
200410,63,63620,89,NA,NA,Only a Coalition Prime Minister could have been host to President Bush and President Hu Jintao on successive days as they addressed joint sittings of our National Parliament.
200410,63,63620,90,NA,NA,"The growth of our trade relationship with China has been one of the great successes of the last eight and a half years,"
200410,63,63620,91,NA,NA,and we have continued to build and strengthen our relations with other countries in the region such as the traditional markets of Japan and Korea.
200410,63,63620,92,NA,NA,It is never necessary in foreign or trade policy to choose between your history and your geography.
200410,63,63620,93,NA,NA,We can remain faithful to our traditional allies and allegiances
200410,63,63620,94,NA,NA,while building and strengthening our partnerships in the region.
200410,63,63620,95,NA,NA,"Foreign policy often carries difficult decisions, and no decision that I've had to make in this area over the last eight and a half years was more difficult than our decision to join the Coalition in Iraq."
200410,63,63620,96,NA,NA,That decision was the right decision.
200410,63,63620,97,NA,NA,"If I had my time again, I would take the same decision."
200410,63,63620,98,NA,NA,"The world is a better place, the Middle East is a better place, without Saddam Hussein."
200410,63,63620,99,NA,NA,Australian forces will stay in Iraq until they finish their job.
200410,63,63620,100,NA,NA,We will not cut and run before Christmas or any other arbitrary date.
200410,63,63620,101,NA,NA,"My friends, we all prize the financial security of our families."
200410,63,63620,102,NA,NA,"Let me say this, and it's not just my view, but it's a view frequently expressed to me as I move around this country talking to Australian families."
200410,63,63620,103,NA,NA,Nothing threatens that security more directly than the prospect of rising interest rates.
200410,63,63620,104,NA,NA,Rising interest rates dominates everything else when it comes to family security.
200410,63,63620,105,NA,NA,Just a tiny upward movement in interest rates more than devours a few dollars of taxation relief or additional family benefits.
200410,63,63620,106,NA,NA,There is no economic credential for office more crucial than a capacity to keep interest rates low.
200410,63,63620,107,NA,NA,"I claim very directly that interest rates under a Labor Government would always be higher than under a Coalition Government, and that claim is based on two things."
200410,63,63620,108,NA,NA,It's based on the historical record of what happened when they were last in government.
200410,63,63620,109,NA,NA,"Nobody will ever forget the 17 per cent housing interest rates, the 20.5 per cent small business interest rates, the 22 or 23 per cent Bill rates that many farmers had to pay."
200410,63,63620,110,NA,NA,Nobody will forget that.
200410,63,63620,111,NA,NA,"If the interest rates that obtained in 1996 had continued, the average borrower in Australia would now be paying $500 a month more on their housing loan."
200410,63,63620,112,NA,NA,That is the dimension of what they did when they last had charge of the Government of this country.
200410,63,63620,113,NA,NA,My claim that interest rates would be higher under Labor is also supported by the impact of their industrial relations policy.
200410,63,63620,114,NA,NA,"They will run an industrial relations policy where wages will rise not based on productivity, because they will take productivity out of the equation, and if wages go up not based on productivity, they become inflationary."
200410,63,63620,115,NA,NA,"And inevitably if you have inflationary wage rises, the Reserve Bank will retaliate by lifting interest rates."
200410,63,63620,116,NA,NA,"That is my case, that is my charge, that is my argument."
200410,63,63620,117,NA,NA,That is why I assert unconditionally that interest rates will always be higher under a Labor Government than a Coalition Government.
200410,63,63620,118,NA,NA,"Our budget, thanks to the magnificent work of Peter Costello and his colleagues, is strong and in surplus."
200410,63,63620,119,NA,NA,They are the surpluses generated by the Coalition in the face of fierce opposition from the Australian Labor Party.
200410,63,63620,120,NA,NA,"As a result, we have been able to invest record amounts in health, in education, in roads, in defence, and to give taxation relief and additional family benefits."
200410,63,63620,121,NA,NA,The Coalition and the Labor Party are divided in this election campaign on many issues.
200410,63,63620,122,NA,NA,But there's one issue on which we are not divided.
200410,63,63620,123,NA,NA,Both sides of politics in Australia are committed to the maintenance of Medicare.
200410,63,63620,124,NA,NA,There is no argument between the Labor Party and the Coalition on Medicare.
200410,63,63620,125,NA,NA,"In fact, the Coalition has strengthened Medicare by the introduction of a Medicare safety net."
200410,63,63620,126,NA,NA,But Labor would abolish the Medicare safety net.
200410,63,63620,127,NA,NA,"Labor would take away a measure that has already provided invaluable support to 600,000 Australians and their families."
200410,63,63620,128,NA,NA,"We have a strong and prosperous economy, but our goals for the future must be to further strengthen and to preserve that strong economy for the benefit of ourselves and our children."
200410,63,63620,129,NA,NA,That can only happen if we are prepared to tackle head on the major challenges that must be faced over the next decade and beyond.
200410,63,63620,130,NA,NA,We must maintain and strengthen the productivity gains of recent years.
200410,63,63620,131,NA,NA,We must further entrench the entrepreneurial culture within the Australian nation.
200410,63,63620,132,NA,NA,We must address the ageing of our population
200410,63,63620,133,NA,NA,and we must balance our need for economic growth with protection of our precious environment.
200410,63,63620,134,NA,NA,So much of our economic growth to date has been based on productivity improvements.
200410,63,63620,135,NA,NA,There are two threats to this.
200410,63,63620,136,NA,NA,"The first of those threats, which I have outlined, is that of Labor's industrial relations policy."
200410,63,63620,137,NA,NA,Labor would return control of industrial relations to the union movement.
200410,63,63620,138,NA,NA,"Only 17.5 per cent of the private sector workforce in this country belongs to a union, yet Labor wants to give 100 per cent control of that system to the trade union movement."
200410,63,63620,139,NA,NA,Labor will abolish Australian Workplace Agreements.
200410,63,63620,140,NA,NA,Labor will adopt a double standard in relation to secondary boycotts under the Trade Practices Act.
200410,63,63620,141,NA,NA,"Labor will give unions a special deal, Labor will bring back preference clauses."
200410,63,63620,142,NA,NA,The cover was blown on that by the CFMEU on Friday.
200410,63,63620,143,NA,NA,Labor will require anybody who makes a contract with the Federal Government to disclose the identity of the subcontractors.
200410,63,63620,144,NA,NA,Labor will go back to the 50s and 60s when it comes to industrial relations
200410,63,63620,145,NA,NA,and that will inevitably produce inflationary wage rises with all the consequences for interest rates that that entails.
200410,63,63620,146,NA,NA,The other great challenge is of course our shortage of skills and in a way this has been a consequence of our very economic success and I will therefore have something to say about that issue in a moment.
200410,63,63620,147,NA,NA,But I have some policy initiatives to outline to you today including one in relation to skills.
200410,63,63620,148,NA,NA,Let me say that all of the initiatives that I outline today reflect very directly the values and attitudes which have shaped me all the years that I’ve spent in public life.
200410,63,63620,149,NA,NA,First and foremost a belief in the central role of the family in the Australian community.
200410,63,63620,150,NA,NA,A belief that the family is the greatest source of emotional support and inspiration that an individual can ever have.
200410,63,63620,151,NA,NA,As the son of a small business owner an unshakeable belief in the role of dynamic small business as an engine of economic progress and personal self-fulfillment.
200410,63,63620,152,NA,NA,A passionate belief in flexible workplaces free of rigidity in the industrial system and unwanted union interference.
200410,63,63620,153,NA,NA,And a firm commitment to strong budgets as the way to keep interest rates down
200410,63,63620,154,NA,NA,and underpin a capacity to spend more in areas of human services.
200410,63,63620,155,NA,NA,There’s a golden thread that runs through so many Coalition policies and that is that great principle of choice.
200410,63,63620,156,NA,NA,Greater choice for families to choose how they will balance their work and their family responsibilities.
200410,63,63620,157,NA,NA,Greater choice for entrepreneurial Australians to start and expand their small business.
200410,63,63620,158,NA,NA,Greater choice and opportunity for young Australians to develop their talents to the full.
200410,63,63620,159,NA,NA,"And importantly, greater choice for Australian parents to decide how and where their children will be educated."
200410,63,63620,160,NA,NA,I also want greater choice in health and education
200410,63,63620,161,NA,NA,backed by an unyielding commitment to universal high standards.
200410,63,63620,162,NA,NA,"Australia should never be a nation defined by class or envy, but rather a nation united by mateship and achievement."
200410,63,63620,163,NA,NA,"Australia is facing a national skills shortage in traditional trades such as carpenters, welders, auto-electricians, motor mechanics, brick layers, chefs and hairdressers."
200410,63,63620,164,NA,NA,This is in part a product of our great economic success.
200410,63,63620,165,NA,NA,It’s also the legacy of some bad decisions we made a generation or more ago.
200410,63,63620,166,NA,NA,This country made a big mistake 30 or 40 years ago when it turned its back on the old system of having technical skills.
200410,63,63620,167,NA,NA,Those skills taught earlier generations to be tradesman and women.
200410,63,63620,168,NA,NA,We now must reinvest in the future of the 70% of young Australians who do not go directly to university when they leave school.
200410,63,63620,169,NA,NA,I want an Australian nation in which a high quality technical education is as prized as a university degree.
200410,63,63620,170,NA,NA,And what is more – so do millions of Australians.
200410,63,63620,171,NA,NA,"We have already announced a number of measures in this area, including the funding of tool kits for 34,000 new apprentices"
200410,63,63620,172,NA,NA,and the establishment of an Institute of Trade Skill Excellence.
200410,63,63620,173,NA,NA,"But today, I announce the centerpiece of our drive to tackle skills shortages and to revolutionise vocational education and training throughout Australia."
200410,63,63620,174,NA,NA,A re-elected Coalition Government will establish 24 Australian Technical Colleges to accelerate national skills development in traditional trades.
200410,63,63620,175,NA,NA,"These select high achievement colleges will provide tuition in a given year for up to 7,200 students in years 11 and 12 and will offer both academic and vocational education to students."
200410,63,63620,176,NA,NA,These colleges will be located in regions suffering serious skills shortages and high rates of youth unemployment and which are supported by a significant industry base.
200410,63,63620,177,NA,NA,"They will be based all around the country, from Darwin to Northern Tasmania, across to Adelaide, to Perth and right here in Queensland."
200410,63,63620,178,NA,NA,"New colleges will be located in Northern Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Gladstone and Townsville."
200410,63,63620,179,NA,NA,These colleges will operate independently of the State education system.
200410,63,63620,180,NA,NA,"They will be run by the principals, and teachers will be recruited on the basis of performance based pay."
200410,63,63620,181,NA,NA,They will send a powerful signal to young Australians that trade skills offer a proven path to a rewarding career.
200410,63,63620,182,NA,NA,To further encourage skills excellence we will also introduce Commonwealth Scholarships for New Apprentices in priority trades after their first and second year of apprenticeship.
200410,63,63620,183,NA,NA,And importantly we will extend the Youth Allowance to apprentices thus putting them on the same footing as university students.
200410,63,63620,184,NA,NA,This will be of particular help to many low income families.
200410,63,63620,185,NA,NA,And also the Coalition will further invest in skills by allocating a portion of the money spent on defence equipment and maintenance towards additional skills training.
200410,63,63620,186,NA,NA,This will represent an investment of an extra $200 million over 10 years for skills development and training.
200410,63,63620,187,NA,NA,A re-elected Coalition Government will invest more than $100 million to build an Australian Network of Industry Careers Advisers.
200410,63,63620,188,NA,NA,We will do this by significantly expanding the role of some 216 community partnerships across Australia especially as a vehicle for partnering industry with professional career advisers.
200410,63,63620,189,NA,NA,We aim at nothing less than assisting all young Australians from age 13 to 19 to make a successful transition from school to an enduring career.
200410,63,63620,190,NA,NA,"My friends, one of the things our network of career advisers will do is to give young Australians greater exposure to local role models running their own businesses."
200410,63,63620,191,NA,NA,Small businesses are the heart and soul of the Australian economy.
200410,63,63620,192,NA,NA,"There are 1.2 million of them, employing almost 3.5 million Australians."
200410,63,63620,193,NA,NA,They are dynamic.
200410,63,63620,194,NA,NA,Many new small businesses are started by women.
200410,63,63620,195,NA,NA,Many operate from home.
200410,63,63620,196,NA,NA,They represent the new face of innovative Australia.
200410,63,63620,197,NA,NA,The new face of entrepreneurial Australia.
200410,63,63620,198,NA,NA,"We must do more to encourage them, to entrench that culture, and to bring on more."
200410,63,63620,199,NA,NA,That’s why I’m especially pleased to announce a series of measures at furthering entrenching the enterprise culture within this country.
200410,63,63620,200,NA,NA,"A re-elected Coalition Government will further reduce small business taxes,"
200410,63,63620,201,NA,NA,consolidate our flexible industrial relations system
200410,63,63620,202,NA,NA,and provide emphasis and impetus to further small business growth.
200410,63,63620,203,NA,NA,"First, we will extend the Simplified Tax System to include businesses accounting on an accruals basis."
200410,63,63620,204,NA,NA,"This will permit more businesses, including in particular, many in the farming sector to take advantage of the concessions associated with the Simplified Taxation System and that will give tax relief of over $330 million to small businesses over a period of three years."
200410,63,63620,205,NA,NA,"Secondly, and importantly, we’re going to provide extra incentive and encouragement to small business growth through the introduction, from the 1st of July next year, of a new 25% Entrepreneurs Tax Discount."
200410,63,63620,206,NA,NA,"Small businesses that are in the Simplified Tax System, and have an annual turnover of $50,000 or less, will be eligible for a 25% discount on their income tax liability in respect of their business income."
200410,63,63620,207,NA,NA,"This initiative is, in essence, a kick-start, a special, upfront incentive for enterprising Australians, especially many of the micro or home-based businesses in the critical, early days of a business when they need that extra help to get a start."
200410,63,63620,208,NA,NA,"The discount will begin to phase out when the turnover passes $50,000."
200410,63,63620,209,NA,NA,The new discount will provide significant relief of more than $900 million over a period of three years.
200410,63,63620,210,NA,NA,We’re also determined to further improve the regulatory environment for small business.
200410,63,63620,211,NA,NA,"Today I announce that stemming from the recent review of the income tax self-assessment system, if re-elected, we will reduce, from the current four years to two years, the amendment period in which the Australian Taxation Office can audit and adjust the tax assessment of businesses within the Simplified Taxation System."
200410,63,63620,212,NA,NA,"It’s an understatement to say that that will significantly reduce the record keeping compliance requirement, and therefore, add to the peace of mind of many men and women in small business."
200410,63,63620,213,NA,NA,I also want to announce another measure – geared towards the burgeoning home based business sector.
200410,63,63620,214,NA,NA,"About 785,000 Australian entrepreneurs operate from home, or largely from home, many more want to start up at home."
200410,63,63620,215,NA,NA,"But one of the problems is that many councils impose restrictions on the types of businesses allowed to operate from home, on floor space, and placement and size of signs, employee numbers and the like."
200410,63,63620,216,NA,NA,"Some councils however, have adopted a more flexible regulatory approach, a framework that allows small businesses a little more freedom."
200410,63,63620,217,NA,NA,So to further encourage the local government sector to help the small business sector the Coalition will introduce a Regulation Reduction Incentive Fund
200410,63,63620,218,NA,NA,and it will be established with an initial amount from the Commonwealth of $50 million and local governments will compete for payments from the fund based on their proposals to reduce red tape and regulatory complexity and compliance requirements for the home-based business sector.
200410,63,63620,219,NA,NA,"Of all of our reforms to small business none of course have been more important than our crusade to improve industrial relations, to give them more freedom and flexibility at the workplace level."
200410,63,63620,220,NA,NA,"And today I want to announce that as a result of the ever increasing contribution that independent contractors make to our economy, a reelected Coalition Government will establish separate legislation to enshrine and protect the status of independent contractors."
200410,63,63620,221,NA,NA,"There are more than a million independent contractors in Australia, including owner-drivers, which includes taxi drivers, sole traders, building sub-contractors and cleaners and the list goes on."
200410,63,63620,222,NA,NA,They opt for freedom and flexibility but they are always under attack from unions.
200410,63,63620,223,NA,NA,And Labor Governments would seek to frustrate them and to get them into the industrial relations net.
200410,63,63620,224,NA,NA,That’s why a re-elected Coalition Government will legislate to protect the rights of independent contractors
200410,63,63620,225,NA,NA,and stop unions looking to restrict their freedom to choose how they want to work.
200410,63,63620,226,NA,NA,"A new Independent Contractors Act would ensure that freedom of contract for independent contractors is enshrined and preserved, that they have a firewall built around them to protect them from the deprivation of unions and unfriendly Labor governments who would seek to impose limits and constraints on their freedom to contract."
200410,63,63620,227,NA,NA,"Our commitment to small business is strong, consistent and enduring."
200410,63,63620,228,NA,NA,"But so, of course, is our commitment to the Australian family, an unshakable belief that it really is the centre of the life of this nation"
200410,63,63620,229,NA,NA,"and a belief that the role of government is not to tell parents how to bring up their children, not to tell parents where they should be educated, not to tell parents whether one or other should be at home full time when the children are young."
200410,63,63620,230,NA,NA,"But rather to create policies and a climate in which parents can decide because they are the best people placed to make that decision – how their children will be raised, where they will be educated and who will care for them and for how long each day."
200410,63,63620,231,NA,NA,"Unlike Mr Latham, I respect those mothers, and in some cases fathers in Australia, who decide that the best thing for them is that mum or dad should be at home full time while the children are young."
200410,63,63620,232,NA,NA,I will never lead a Government that punishes and penalises stay at home mothers.
200410,63,63620,233,NA,NA,"How dare Mr Latham say to a single income family on $35,000 a year with three children that that family should be $461 a year worse off."
200410,63,63620,234,NA,NA,"We have brought the principle of choice to all of our policies and importantly, I bring a new dimension to our policies today in relation to childcare."
200410,63,63620,235,NA,NA,"We have spent more than $8 billion on childcare in the six years from 1996 to 2002, more than double that in the last six years of the Labor Government."
200410,63,63620,236,NA,NA,Our policies have seen an 84 per cent increase in the number of childcare places
200410,63,63620,237,NA,NA,"and as part of our ongoing commitment to supporting parental choice in relation to childcare,"
200410,63,63620,238,NA,NA,"I announce today that if the Coalition is re-elected, we will introduce a new taxation rebate of 30 per cent on parents out of pocket childcare expenses."
200410,63,63620,239,NA,NA,"This new rebate recognises that childcare costs faced by families vary enormously across the country, and providing a rebate on the out of pocket cost, supports families choosing the childcare service which best suits their needs."
200410,63,63620,240,NA,NA,"At the same time, to ensure complete fairness of treatment for families where one parent makes the choice to stay at home full time, we will provide an appropriate increase in the rate of Family Tax Benefit B."
200410,63,63620,241,NA,NA,That is the benefit paid to parents who are at home full time caring for their children.
200410,63,63620,242,NA,NA,"We also, I believe, need these days to be more responsive as a society to the special needs of grandparents who are called increasingly to look after grandchildren as a result of family breakdowns."
200410,63,63620,243,NA,NA,They are heroic people.
200410,63,63620,244,NA,NA,They’ve spent their lives raising their own children and suddenly they find they must do the same thing again for their grandchildren.
200410,63,63620,245,NA,NA,And they do it out of the love they naturally have for those children.
200410,63,63620,246,NA,NA,"And to give grandparents caring for their grandchildren greater support, a re-elected Coalition government will improve access to child care through a relaxation of the eligibility requirements and greater access to higher benefits."
200410,63,63620,247,NA,NA,We’ll waive the work study training test for access to child care benefits and that will enable grandparents to access full time childcare at 50 hours a week if required.
200410,63,63620,248,NA,NA,"We’ll also make child care more affordable for grandparents in receipt of income support, by enabling them to have access to special rate child care benefit."
200410,63,63620,249,NA,NA,"Earlier this year, with Brendan Nelson, I announced that the Coalition would invest a record $31.3 billion in Australia’s schools over the next four years."
200410,63,63620,250,NA,NA,That was an increase of $8 billion over the previous 4 years.
200410,63,63620,251,NA,NA,We will continue to drive high national standards in Australian schools including through our flagship literacy and numeracy programmes.
200410,63,63620,252,NA,NA,We are ensuring that students benefit through greater national consistency and from values programmes
200410,63,63620,253,NA,NA,"and we’ll ensure that parents receive plain English language reports, so they know how their child is performing against national benchmarks."
200410,63,63620,254,NA,NA,We will maintain our unwavering commitment to the right of parents to decide where their children will be educated.
200410,63,63620,255,NA,NA,The Coalition has an unconditional commitment to parental choice in education.
200410,63,63620,256,NA,NA,There will be no hit lists under the Coalition.
200410,63,63620,257,NA,NA,"Hit lists never shrink, they only grow."
200410,63,63620,258,NA,NA,"Consistently over the years, the Commonwealth has looked in dismay at the failure of State Governments around Australia to match the funding increases for their own government schools, at the same rate as the Commonwealth has increased its share of the funding of government schools."
200410,63,63620,259,NA,NA,"This, notwithstanding the growing revenues that State Governments are receiving from the GST."
200410,63,63620,260,NA,NA,"I am no longer prepared in the face of this to do nothing further, because I believe that there are some areas of assistance both in relation to government schools and the poorer resourced independent schools that need some assistance."
200410,63,63620,261,NA,NA,Our strong budget position means that we can now afford to make an additional capital injection into those two categories of schools.
200410,63,63620,262,NA,NA,"A re-elected Coalition government will invest over a period of four years, an additional $1 billion over its existing funding, to upgrade classrooms, libraries, basic amenities and grounds of government and poorly resourced non-government schools."
200410,63,63620,263,NA,NA,"In relation to the government schools, we're going to do things a little differently this time."
200410,63,63620,264,NA,NA,We're not going to pay the money to the State Governments.
200410,63,63620,265,NA,NA,We're going to deal directly with the parent bodies.
200410,63,63620,266,NA,NA,"We're going to ask the parent bodies, in conjunction with the principals, to submit their plans directly to the Federal Government."
200410,63,63620,267,NA,NA,"And of the billion dollars, $700 million is going to be allocated to government schools and $300 million to the poorer resourced Catholic and independent schools."
200410,63,63620,268,NA,NA,And pity help any state government that tries to get in the way of the local P&C getting their share of this new programme.
200410,63,63620,269,NA,NA,"I said earlier that there were many issues that divided the Government and the Labor Party, but one of them was not Medicare."
200410,63,63620,270,NA,NA,"In Australia, we're very fortunate to have a strong network of general practice as the first line of treatment for illness and injury."
200410,63,63620,271,NA,NA,And our goal is to ensure that as many people as possible have access to quality and convenient GP services when they need them.
200410,63,63620,272,NA,NA,"Earlier in the campaign I announced 100 per cent Medicare, which from the 1st of January next year will increase GP Medicare rebates to 100 per cent of the Medicare fee."
200410,63,63620,273,NA,NA,"Today I am delighted to announce Round the Clock Medicare, the Coalition's plan to increase Australians' access to after hours General Practitioner services."
200410,63,63620,274,NA,NA,This programme will extend the benefits of these initiatives to weeknights and weekends.
200410,63,63620,275,NA,NA,"While it is relatively easy to find a GP in most parts, not all parts, in standard hours, it's more difficult to find GPs providing services after hours - weekdays and evenings and weekends, Saturday afternoons and on Sundays."
200410,63,63620,276,NA,NA,And this new programme - Round the Clock Medicare - invests in after hours GP services in two ways.
200410,63,63620,277,NA,NA,Firstly by giving GPs greater incentives to practice after hours by increasing Medicare rebates on after hours GP services by $10 from the 1st of January 2005.
200410,63,63620,278,NA,NA,This loading will be over and above the other benefits of strengthening Medicare and 100 per cent Medicare.
200410,63,63620,279,NA,NA,"And secondly, investing in much needed after hours GP infrastructure by providing recurrent operating subsidies to up to 30 after hours GP services in areas of high demand; providing startup funding to up to 30 new after hours GP services, and providing recurrent supplementary assistance to up to 100 after hours services in outer suburban and regional areas to ensure their viability."
200410,63,63620,280,NA,NA,"Labor's preferred solution is after hours GP clinics co-located with public hospitals, but this is a partial and limited approach."
200410,63,63620,281,NA,NA,"The Coalition's after hours plan will encourage a range of models, including GP cooperatives, mobile medical locum services, and dedicated free standing after hours clinics."
200410,63,63620,282,NA,NA,"And I repeat, so that there is no misunderstanding."
200410,63,63620,283,NA,NA,"We will retain the Medicare Safety Net, Labor will cut it out of the heart of Medicare."
200410,63,63620,284,NA,NA,"My friends, the Coalition has a vision for a world class system of aged care"
200410,63,63620,285,NA,NA,that recognises the individual needs of older Australians.
200410,63,63620,286,NA,NA,"The Coalition understands that if older Australians need care, they want choice in when, how and where it is delivered, and increasingly they want it delivered to them at home."
200410,63,63620,287,NA,NA,"We also recognize the profound effect that dementia has on those living with the condition, their carers, their families and their other loved ones, and indeed our community as a whole."
200410,63,63620,288,NA,NA,A reelected Coalition Government therefore will allocate $200 million over a period of four years to support a major dementia initiative.
200410,63,63620,289,NA,NA,"First, we will invest $52 million over the next four years to assist people with dementia by making dementia a National Health Priority."
200410,63,63620,290,NA,NA,"This will provide a focus for collaboration between governments and other organisations for monitoring, reporting on and developing strategies to improve health outcomes for people living with dementia."
200410,63,63620,291,NA,NA,"Second, we'll provide $127 million for an extra 2,000 extended Aged Care In the Home packages, specifically targeted to people with dementia."
200410,63,63620,292,NA,NA,"And third, we'll provide $20 million to expand the Carer Education and Workforce Training project."
200410,63,63620,293,NA,NA,"This will provide dementia specific training for up to 8,000 community care staff and residential care workers, and up to 6,000 extra carers and community workers such as police and transport staff."
200410,63,63620,294,NA,NA,"This is a necessary response to a growing health challenge that affects a growing number of people in the community, and I want it to be one of the major health priorities of the Government in its next term."
200410,63,63620,295,NA,NA,"My friends, the initiatives I have outlined this morning underpin our commitment to a stronger economic future for our nation."
200410,63,63620,296,NA,NA,They have been made possible only because of the economic success of the last eight and a half years.
200410,63,63620,297,NA,NA,Promises made in an election campaign mean nothing if you don't have a strong economy providing the wherewithal to make those promises affordable and achievable.
200410,63,63620,298,NA,NA,"Without a strong economy, you cannot sustain the automatic indexation of the aged pension."
200410,63,63620,299,NA,NA,"Without a strong economy, you cannot sustain a growing investment in health and education."
200410,63,63620,300,NA,NA,"Without a strong economy, you cannot sustain a growing investment in roads."
200410,63,63620,301,NA,NA,"Without a strong economy, you cannot afford to adequately defend the nation."
200410,63,63620,302,NA,NA,"Without a strong economy, you cannot deliver security and certainty to Australian families so that they can live their lives in peace and plan carefully for their future."
200410,63,63620,303,NA,NA,"The greatest legacy that this Government has given the Australian nation over the last eight and a half years is the strongest, best performing economy that we have seen since World War II."
200410,63,63620,304,NA,NA,It has not happened by accident.
200410,63,63620,305,NA,NA,It's not a fluke.
200410,63,63620,306,NA,NA,It's not been done by signing pieces of cardboard.
200410,63,63620,307,NA,NA,It has been done by hard work and difficult decisions.
200410,63,63620,308,NA,NA,"And again let me remind you, it's been done in the teeth of tenacious opposition from the Labor Party to virtually every fundamental reform that we have tried to bring about."
200410,63,63620,309,NA,NA,"They tried to stop us getting the budget back into the black, they opposed our industrial relations reforms, they opposed our taxation reforms, they opposed many of our welfare reforms."
200410,63,63620,310,NA,NA,"They have been not only a failure in government in terms of budget policy, but they have been a negative force in Opposition."
200410,63,63620,311,NA,NA,"My friends, Australian families want security and the greatest security that we can give them is the assurance that their interest rates will be kept as low as possible."
200410,63,63620,312,NA,NA,Nothing threatens their security more than the prospect of rising interest rates.
200410,63,63620,313,NA,NA,"Nothing is more certain than if economic policy is allowed to slip into the hands of those who, when they last had control of it, delivered five budget deficits in a row, that there will be massive upward pressure on interest rates."
200410,63,63620,314,NA,NA,"My friends, there is much to be done."
200410,63,63620,315,NA,NA,"The journey of the last eight and a half years has been a journey which has brought us a stronger, prouder, more prosperous, more respected Australia."
200410,63,63620,316,NA,NA,"An Australia bound together by the common bonds of egalitarianism and mateship, an Australia made up of people proudly drawn from the four corners of the earth - all of them making a wonderful contribution to our modern nation, a modern nation which is proud of its history, proud of its traditions, but ready to change and adapt in the face of changing world circumstances."
200410,63,63620,317,NA,NA,We Australians have many characteristics.
200410,63,63620,318,NA,NA,We are tough when it's needed.
200410,63,63620,319,NA,NA,We're warm and soft and compassionate when that's needed.
200410,63,63620,320,NA,NA,But we're also adaptable.
200410,63,63620,321,NA,NA,Australians are great improvisers.
200410,63,63620,322,NA,NA,We adapt to change.
200410,63,63620,323,NA,NA,It must have something to do with our bush background and the need to innovate and be ready for changed circumstances and to get by in a difficult situation.
200410,63,63620,324,NA,NA,And our workplace has changed over the last 20 years.
200410,63,63620,325,NA,NA,We understand that we live in a globalised economy and that we must relate to that if we are to survive and we are to prosper.
200410,63,63620,326,NA,NA,"It's because of those things, that only the policies of a Coalition Government, with its rejection of the rigidities of the old industrial relations system, that can guarantee a continuation of the productivity and the growth that has brought us this distance."
200410,63,63620,327,NA,NA,"My friends, we do face that simple choice on the 9th of October - a choice between a Coalition which has demonstrated a capacity to deliver security to the nation and security to the nation's families."
200410,63,63620,328,NA,NA,A Coalition that has demonstrated a capacity to project the policies for the future that will guarantee a continuation of our productivity and all the other changes that are needed to deliver us even greater prosperity.
200410,63,63620,329,NA,NA,"And the alternative is a Labor Party which is still locked in its trade union industrial relations past, that despite all of the changes of the modern world, still believes that individual Australian workers cannot be trusted to make a decision on their own as to their employment conditions, that still believe despite the dwindling trade union membership in this nation, that 100 per cent of decisions in relation to industrial relations should be given to the trade union movement."
200410,63,63620,330,NA,NA,"My friends, it has been an immense privilege to be the Prime Minister of this wonderful country over the last eight and a half years, a privilege I have shared with some wonderful colleagues, and a privilege which all of us want to go on sharing so that we can re-dedicate ourselves to the service of the Australian people and the great cause of the nation we love so much."
200410,63,63810,7,NA,NA,It is our unshakeable belief that the government we are privileged to help lead is the stronger because it is a Coalition.
200410,63,63810,8,NA,NA,"And we are equally unshakeable in our belief that the team you see, together, before you today is the better team to take our nation forward over the next three years."
200410,63,63810,9,NA,NA,Peter Costello – let me say how much I’ve enjoyed working with you in government over the past eight-and-a-half years.
200410,63,63810,10,NA,NA,"Let me record my respect for you, for your competency, and your commitment to Australians, and let me acknowledge the crown you’ve surely earned as Australia’s best-ever Treasurer."
200410,63,63810,11,NA,NA,"The outstanding economic management of the past eight and a half years - the lowest inflation in decades, the lowest interest rates in decades, the lowest transport and waterfront costs ever in real terms - has been totally critical to the survival of countless farms and small businesses during the worst drought in 100 years."
200410,63,63810,12,NA,NA,"As Warren Truss points out, serious as it has been, the damage wreaked by this drought has been much less serious than the devastation of the 90s drought, when farmers and small businesses in the country were paying more than 20 percent interest rates."
200410,63,63810,13,NA,NA,Remember them?
200410,63,63810,14,NA,NA,Don’t ever forget who gave them to you.
200410,63,63810,15,NA,NA,In those days the major tenant in the main streets of our regional towns was someone called “For Lease”.
200410,63,63810,16,NA,NA,"Over our time in office no less than 440,000 new jobs have been created in regional Australia."
200410,63,63810,17,NA,NA,"Unemployment is down from 9.3 percent in March 1996 to 6.1 percent today, compared with 5 percent in the cities."
200410,63,63810,18,NA,NA,We aim to bring it down still more.
200410,63,63810,19,NA,NA,Country Australians will never be forgotten Australians while we are in government.
200410,63,63810,20,NA,NA,We’ve not forgotten them as we have tackled big policy issues like water and transport infrastructure and trade and the future of agriculture.
200410,63,63810,21,NA,NA,The National Water Initiative coupled with the $2 billion water package announced by the Prime Minister and I in Adelaide two weeks ago restores certainty and security in water management for the environment and for water users.
200410,63,63810,22,NA,NA,"The money will help us do so much more, so much better, on the driest inhabited continent on earth, where the residents use more water per year than anyone else in the OECD."
200410,63,63810,23,NA,NA,Australia will see the equivalent of two Snowy Mountain Schemes in road and rail nation building over the next five years.
200410,63,63810,24,NA,NA,We can invest $12.5 billion because we have managed the economy properly.
200410,63,63810,25,NA,NA,"Mark Vaile’s work on the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement sees him earn his place with John McEwen, who secured the Australia-Japan Pact in 1957."
200410,63,63810,26,NA,NA,"Like Black Jack, Mark Vaile could see the jobs that his trade agreement would bring"
200410,63,63810,27,NA,NA,– while the Australian Labor Party was blind to the opportunities.
200410,63,63810,28,NA,NA,"Warren Truss with the Agriculture Advancing Australia initiative, through programmes like Farm Management Deposits, FarmBiz and his vital sugar assistance package, has developed clear pathways for the future for those who grow our food and fibre."
200410,63,63810,29,NA,NA,We went into office in 1996 with a vision.
200410,63,63810,30,NA,NA,It’s a vision that we still hold to now:
200410,63,63810,31,NA,NA,• to restore the regional services that had withered under Labor;
200410,63,63810,32,NA,NA,• to encourage new businesses and industries into our regional towns and cities;
200410,63,63810,33,NA,NA,"• to help rebuild regional communities so they were once again places where we could not only bring up our children in safety, but also offer our young adults a secure and rewarding future; and"
200410,63,63810,34,NA,NA,• to give the people of regional Australia the power to make their own decisions about what is best for them and to give them the tools to do it.
200410,63,63810,35,NA,NA,"And because we are practical people in The Nationals, it has been a practical vision – with practical outcomes."
200410,63,63810,36,NA,NA,"We found a new way to give country people an effective mobile phone service,"
200410,63,63810,37,NA,NA,after the Labor Government’s disastrous and cynical decision to close the analogue mobile phone network.
200410,63,63810,38,NA,NA,"We have helped small centres restore the government, financial and community services lost in the Labor years by helping them set up rural transaction centres."
200410,63,63810,39,NA,NA,And we have made sure that local people – not bureaucrats in Canberra – choose the services that local people get.
200410,63,63810,40,NA,NA,"We have ensured that universities take more country kids into their medical schools, because we know that country kids are more likely to return to the regional Australia they grew up in, and become country doctors and nurses."
200410,63,63810,41,NA,NA,"We have made sure that Australian Government money to improve local roads is paid direct to local government, so that local councils can apply their own local priorities."
200410,63,63810,42,NA,NA,"And we rewrote the rules for regional development programmes to forge a partnership between Commonwealth and community, because we know that the best solution to a local problem is the solution that local people find and support."
200410,63,63810,43,NA,NA,There is now a real sense of resurgence in many country towns and communities.
200410,63,63810,44,NA,NA,The “For Lease” signs are coming down and being replaced by new business names as people are encouraged by a stable and growing economy to get out and have a go.
200410,63,63810,45,NA,NA,"There are new industries, more jobs, better jobs, and towns are again looking neat and proud and their business centres more vibrant."
200410,63,63810,46,NA,NA,The revitalisation of regional Australia is also encouraging people to stay in regional Australia.
200410,63,63810,47,NA,NA,"Three weeks ago, I met a young couple living and working in Gladstone."
200410,63,63810,48,NA,NA,"They have just bought their first home with the help of this Government’s first-home owners’ scheme,"
200410,63,63810,49,NA,NA,and are planning a family.
200410,63,63810,50,NA,NA,"Buying a house is a big commitment and for this couple it is not just a financial commitment, but a commitment to Gladstone as well."
200410,63,63810,51,NA,NA,They have made a decision to stay in their regional city.
200410,63,63810,52,NA,NA,The low mortgage interest rates flowing from this government’s policies played a big part in their decision to buy a house; and their confidence in the economic future of Gladstone underwrites their decision to stay.
200410,63,63810,53,NA,NA,They have a lot at stake.
200410,63,63810,54,NA,NA,"Gladstone and Charters Towers here in Queensland, Murwillumbah and Ballina in NSW, Sale and Bairnsdale in Victoria – the whole of regional Australia – has a lot at stake in this election."
200410,63,63810,55,NA,NA,Because all the good work and progress that this government has achieved for regional Australia is under threat from a Latham Labor government.
200410,63,63810,56,NA,NA,The Nationals have achieved a lot for regional Australia because we have been a strong and hard-working responsible coalition partner with the Liberal Party.
200410,63,63810,57,NA,NA,"I know how coalitions work, and I know what can be done."
200410,63,63810,58,NA,NA,What concerns me is the possibility of the future of regional Australia being in the hands of a different sort of Coalition – an alliance between a Latham Labor government and Bob Brown’s Greens.
200410,63,63810,59,NA,NA,"This is an alliance that would remove the certainty of economic management that underpins Australia’s low interest rate, low inflation economy,"
200410,63,63810,60,NA,NA,and would drive up the cost of home ownership and business investment in every regional city and country town.
200410,63,63810,61,NA,NA,"It is an alliance that would be held hostage to radical green environmental agendas, and would undermine the investment in our minerals industries that is the basis of regional economies like that of Gladstone –"
200410,63,63810,62,NA,NA,where our young couple is about to start a family.
200410,63,63810,63,NA,NA,"It would blame farmers for growing food,"
200410,63,63810,64,NA,NA,and rob them of the water they use to provide our cities with the freshest and best value food in the world.
200410,63,63810,65,NA,NA,Labor states and territories would feel free to plunder the Commonwealth purse to prop up their own failed budgets
200410,63,63810,66,NA,NA,while continuing their mismanagement of our public hospitals and public schools
200410,63,63810,67,NA,NA,"- or, in the case of regional Australia, to simply close the hospitals and schools and walk away."
200410,63,63810,68,NA,NA,"And it is an alliance that would undermine the family and social values that country people – I believe most Australians – hold dear, by dangerous social experimentations in drug policy."

200711,63,63320,85,NA,NA,It has run out of energy.
200711,63,63320,86,NA,NA,And it has run out of time.
200711,63,63320,87,NA,NA,"I am offering new leadership with a plan for the future - Mr Howard is offering no leadership, other than a plan to retire and handover to Peter Costello."
200711,63,63320,88,NA,NA,At Mr Howard’s policy launch on Monday there was nothing on climate change.
200711,63,63320,89,NA,NA,Nothing on water.
200711,63,63320,90,NA,NA,Nothing on hospitals.
200711,63,63320,91,NA,NA,Nothing on infrastructure.
200711,63,63320,92,NA,NA,"And whatever amount of money Mr Howard may yet throw at these long standing challenges over the next ten days, it just not going to be real."
200711,63,63320,93,NA,NA,"The truth is, it’s all just too late to be believable."
200711,63,63320,94,NA,NA,"Remarkably as interest rates rose yet again last week, we now find Mr Howard running up the white flag on inflation, and running up a huge bill in a desperate bid to get re-elected."
200711,63,63320,95,NA,NA,A bill he is happy to leave for us all to pay — once he heads off into retirement.
200711,63,63320,96,NA,NA,Monday’s feeding frenzy of expenditure would actually make inflationary pressures worse.
200711,63,63320,97,NA,NA,Mr Howard spent nearly $10 billion on Monday.
200711,63,63320,98,NA,NA,Trying to buy his way out of political trouble.
200711,63,63320,99,NA,NA,And he did so little more than an hour after the Reserve Bank of Australia issued its monetary policy statement warning of rising inflationary pressures.
200711,63,63320,100,NA,NA,How irresponsible can you get?
200711,63,63320,101,NA,NA,Mr Howard has already presided over ten interest rate rises in a row.
200711,63,63320,102,NA,NA,Six interest rate rises since the last election when he promised working families they would remain at record lows.
200711,63,63320,103,NA,NA,A broken promise now costing first homebuyers nearly $3000 a year more on an average mortgage.
200711,63,63320,104,NA,NA,He has ignored 20 separate Reserve Bank warnings on Australia’s skills shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks.
200711,63,63320,105,NA,NA,"And now with this latest irresponsible and desperate pre-election splurge, Mr Howard is putting his own interests ahead of working families by risking further increases in their mortgage rates."
200711,63,63320,106,NA,NA,I have no intention today of repeating Mr Howard’s irresponsible spending spree.
200711,63,63320,107,NA,NA,"· Unlike Mr Howard, I will heed the warnings of the Reserve Bank."
200711,63,63320,108,NA,NA,"· Unlike Mr Howard, I will not place in jeopardy households already struggling with mortgages."
200711,63,63320,109,NA,NA,"· Unlike Mr Howard, I don’t stand before you with a bag full of irresponsible promises that could put upward pressure on inflation."
200711,63,63320,110,NA,NA,Today I am saying loud and clear that this sort of reckless spending must stop.
200711,63,63320,111,NA,NA,I am determined that any commitments I make are first and foremost economically responsible.
200711,63,63320,112,NA,NA,That’s why the commitments I announce today will cost less than one quarter of those Mr Howard announced on Monday.
200711,63,63320,113,NA,NA,"Furthermore, the commitments I am making today are exclusively directed at tackling the skills shortage, tackling infrastructure bottlenecks and acting on Australia’s environmental and economic challenges."
200711,63,63320,114,NA,NA,I have said I will spend less than Mr Howard. I have said I will not match his spending dollar for dollar.
200711,63,63320,115,NA,NA,And I have said I am an economic conservative.
200711,63,63320,116,NA,NA,"Today, I deliver on each of these undertakings."
200711,63,63320,117,NA,NA,Mounting inflation and rising interest rates are a scourge on working families.
200711,63,63320,118,NA,NA,And I believe governments must do everything in their power to place downward pressure on inflation and protect family budgets from rising interest rates.
200711,63,63320,119,NA,NA,Because family budgets right around Australia are already under pressure from WorkChoices.
200711,63,63320,120,NA,NA,"Of course, Mr Howard will continue his fear campaign on interest rates — while always forgetting to remind us that interest rates hit 22 per cent when he was Treasurer during the 1980s."
200711,63,63320,121,NA,NA,We’ve learnt from the experiences of the 1980s.
200711,63,63320,122,NA,NA,But it seems from Mr Howard’s irresponsible spendathon on Monday he has now forgotten them.
200711,63,63320,123,NA,NA,It is not just that Mr Howard has no plan to fight inflation.
200711,63,63320,124,NA,NA,He has failed to advance any credible plan to deal with the future challenges our nation now confronts.
200711,63,63320,125,NA,NA,"On hospitals, we have put forward a national plan to end the buck-passing between Canberra and the States."
200711,63,63320,126,NA,NA,I have a long-term plan to fix our nation’s hospitals.
200711,63,63320,127,NA,NA,"I will be responsible for implementing my plan, and I state this with absolute clarity: the buck will stop with me."
200711,63,63320,128,NA,NA,"Mr Howard, by contrast, has put forward no new plan."
200711,63,63320,129,NA,NA,"He prefers to continue buck-passing to the States, instead of taking responsibility for fixing the system."
200711,63,63320,130,NA,NA,"Australians are fed up with this tired, old game."
200711,63,63320,131,NA,NA,Australians want a long term solution for our hospitals.
200711,63,63320,132,NA,NA,They are sick and tired of short term excuses for not fixing our hospitals.
200711,63,63320,133,NA,NA,"· We will deliver 2,000 extra aged care beds to take the pressure off acute hospital beds."
200711,63,63320,134,NA,NA,· GP SuperClinics around Australia to take the pressure of accident and emergency departments.
200711,63,63320,135,NA,NA,· A national fund to eliminate elective surgery waiting lists beyond clinically acceptable times.
200711,63,63320,136,NA,NA,· A massive national investment in the war against cancer.
200711,63,63320,137,NA,NA,"· And 10 years after Mr Howard abolished it, we will re-establish a Commonwealth Public Dental Program."
200711,63,63320,138,NA,NA,Mr Howard has spent a decade in denial on the critical challenge of climate change.
200711,63,63320,139,NA,NA,"Even now, Mr Howard still opposes Kyoto."
200711,63,63320,140,NA,NA,"I make this commitment: If we are elected, I will immediately ratify Kyoto."
200711,63,63320,141,NA,NA,Mr Howard has opposed carbon targets and emissions trading.
200711,63,63320,142,NA,NA,"If elected, I will implement a 60 per cent carbon target and establish Australia’s first national emissions trading scheme."
200711,63,63320,143,NA,NA,Mr Howard has opposed boosting the renewable energy target.
200711,63,63320,144,NA,NA,"If elected, I will implement a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 so that Australia can have a solar future."
200711,63,63320,145,NA,NA,I'll establish clean coal innovation fund.
200711,63,63320,146,NA,NA,"And today I announce that if elected I will set up a major new renewable energy fund to develop, commercialise and deploy renewable energy technologies across Australia."
200711,63,63320,147,NA,NA,"We need to harness our enormous potential in solar, wind, geothermal and wave power."
200711,63,63320,148,NA,NA,This fund will support projects that take renewable energy technology from the lab to the grid.
200711,63,63320,149,NA,NA,I am determined to make Australia part of the global climate change solution — not just part of the global climate change problem.
200711,63,63320,150,NA,NA,Mr Costello has said the national government has no role in urban water.
200711,63,63320,151,NA,NA,I fundamentally disagree.
200711,63,63320,152,NA,NA,Climate change has made urban and rural water supplies a matter of national significance and therefore a matter of national responsibility.
200711,63,63320,153,NA,NA,That’s why if elected we will establish a National Desalination and Urban Water Recycling Fund.
200711,63,63320,154,NA,NA,It is irresponsible for any national government of Australia to stand idly by while our major cities are threatened by the insecurity of water supply.
200711,63,63320,155,NA,NA,This national fund is designed to deliver new desalination and water recycling projects right across Australia.
200711,63,63320,156,NA,NA,"To help support projects in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane — and other cities - which provide long term security of water supply."
200711,63,63320,157,NA,NA,For 11 years Mr Howard’s government has failed to provide leadership in developing our nation’s infrastructure.
200711,63,63320,158,NA,NA,"If elected, I will provide that leadership."
200711,63,63320,159,NA,NA,I will establish Infrastructure Australia - to tackle the nation’s infrastructure bottlenecks.
200711,63,63320,160,NA,NA,I will establish a Building Australia Fund.
200711,63,63320,161,NA,NA,"And as one of our first nation-building investments, in partnership with the private sector, we will build a state of the art, fibre optic to the node, National Broadband Network."
200711,63,63320,162,NA,NA,"Mr Howard’s government offers a second rate, two-speed network — one for the capital cities and one slow and unreliable system for the rest of Australia."
200711,63,63320,163,NA,NA,"Labor, by contrast, will deliver broadband for the entire nation."
200711,63,63320,164,NA,NA,Nation building requires vision.
200711,63,63320,165,NA,NA,And the cornerstone of my vision for Australia’s future is an education revolution.
200711,63,63320,166,NA,NA,I spoke about Australia’s need for an education revolution in my very first speech to Parliament nearly 10 years ago.
200711,63,63320,167,NA,NA,I have been speaking about it all year.
200711,63,63320,168,NA,NA,Because I believe passionately in the power of education.
200711,63,63320,169,NA,NA,I believe education is the engine room of equity.
200711,63,63320,170,NA,NA,The engine room of opportunity.
200711,63,63320,171,NA,NA,And the engine room of the economy.
200711,63,63320,172,NA,NA,"I would not be standing here before you today were it not for the encouragement, instruction and opportunity provided to me by the teachers who shaped my life."
200711,63,63320,173,NA,NA,"They made it possible for a kid like me from country Queensland to finish school, go to university, become a diplomat and stand here today seeking to lead our nation into the future."
200711,63,63320,174,NA,NA,I know the difference a great education can make.
200711,63,63320,175,NA,NA,I want every child growing up in Australia to have the opportunity of fulfilling their potential.
200711,63,63320,176,NA,NA,"My vision for Australia is to build the best education system in the world — so that we produce the most innovative, the most skilled and the best trained workforce in the world."
200711,63,63320,177,NA,NA,The sad reality is that over the last decade Australia has been falling behind.
200711,63,63320,178,NA,NA,"Falling behind in early childhood education, in trades training and in our national funding for universities."
200711,63,63320,179,NA,NA,The economies we are competing against are making huge new investments in education.
200711,63,63320,180,NA,NA,They know that knowledge intensive economies will be the wealthiest economies of the future.
200711,63,63320,181,NA,NA,We must take decisive action now.
200711,63,63320,182,NA,NA,We need nothing less than an education revolution now.
200711,63,63320,183,NA,NA,A revolution in the quantum of our national investment across the entire education spectrum.
200711,63,63320,184,NA,NA,And a revolution in the quality of those investments — to improve radically the performance of the education system.
200711,63,63320,185,NA,NA,"Right now, Australia’s investment in early childhood education is the lowest of any advanced nation on earth."
200711,63,63320,186,NA,NA,That’s why we announced in chapter one of our education revolution that we will provide 15 hours a week for 40 weeks a year in pre-literacy and pre-numeracy play-based learning for every four year old in the country.
200711,63,63320,187,NA,NA,In chapter two we announced we will introduce a 50 per cent Education Tax Refund to enable parents to claim a refund for their investment in the modern tools and resources of their children’s education.
200711,63,63320,188,NA,NA,"In chapter three we announced we will tackle the chronic shortage of maths and science teachers by halving HECs for those disciplines at university,"
200711,63,63320,189,NA,NA,and we’ll halve it again for those graduates who go on to teach maths and science in our schools.
200711,63,63320,190,NA,NA,In chapter four we announced we will introduce comprehensive Asian language education across the school system to equip the next generation of Australians with the languages of the major economies of the future.
200711,63,63320,191,NA,NA,"In chapter five we announced we will build state of the art Trades Training Centres for each of Australia’s 2,650 secondary schools."
200711,63,63320,192,NA,NA,Today I announce three further chapters in Labor’s education revolution.
200711,63,63320,193,NA,NA,Australia at present is suffering an acute skills crisis that is driving up inflationary pressures.
200711,63,63320,194,NA,NA,"The government itself projects that Australia will suffer a shortage of qualified workers of more than 200,000 workers by 2010."
200711,63,63320,195,NA,NA,Today I announce a plan to tackle the skills crisis head on.
200711,63,63320,196,NA,NA,"Over the next four years, a Federal Labor government will fund an additional 450,000 training places across Australia."
200711,63,63320,197,NA,NA,"Within this, we will support up to 65,000 more apprenticeships over the next four years."
200711,63,63320,198,NA,NA,"We will act on the repeated calls from small and large businesses for more skilled workers, higher level skills training and for the training system to be more responsive to their needs."
200711,63,63320,199,NA,NA,Two-thirds of the new places will be allocated to training people who need to update or lift their skills.
200711,63,63320,200,NA,NA,One third of these additional places will be allocated to people currently outside or marginally attached to the workforce - to equip them with the skills they need to gain employment.
200711,63,63320,201,NA,NA,"Under Skilling Australia, new skilled training places for those outside the workforce will be available from April 2008."
200711,63,63320,202,NA,NA,This will ensure that some of these courses could be completed as early as June 2008 — thus stimulating immediate increased participation in the workforce.
200711,63,63320,203,NA,NA,"To lift workforce participation now and to have an immediate impact on our skills shortages and inflationary pressures, we must get those on the margins of the workforce back into the workforce."
200711,63,63320,204,NA,NA,"Another key to fighting inflation and delivering long term economic growth is investment in 21st century infrastructure, such as high-speed broadband."
200711,63,63320,205,NA,NA,Right now high-speed broadband is transforming economies all round the world.
200711,63,63320,206,NA,NA,The economic impact of the broadband revolution could be greater than the industrial revolution two centuries ago.
200711,63,63320,207,NA,NA,The problem again for Australia is that we are falling behind other nations.
200711,63,63320,208,NA,NA,"We have one of the slowest, most expensive broadband networks in the developed world."
200711,63,63320,209,NA,NA,We must turn the corner now.
200711,63,63320,210,NA,NA,It starts with rolling out a genuine high speed National Broadband Network.
200711,63,63320,211,NA,NA,And it carries on to the next chapter in our education revolution: linking this network to our schools.
200711,63,63320,212,NA,NA,"I announce today that if elected we will connect Australia’s more than 9,000 primary and secondary schools to our National Broadband Network - at speeds of up to 100 megabits per second."
200711,63,63320,213,NA,NA,"And our most remote schools will be provided with alternative high speed systems, where fibre optic can’t physically be delivered."
200711,63,63320,214,NA,NA,The next step is to make sure that the students of tomorrow are properly trained in the technology of tomorrow.
200711,63,63320,215,NA,NA,Not simply word processing skills.
200711,63,63320,216,NA,NA,Not simply computing skills.
200711,63,63320,217,NA,NA,But using broadband - through individual computer terminals - to deliver education programs right across the school curriculum.
200711,63,63320,218,NA,NA,"Today I announce that if elected, Federal Labor will undertake a ground-breaking reform by providing for every Australian secondary school student in years nine to 12 with access to their own computer at school."
200711,63,63320,219,NA,NA,This is an education revolution.
200711,63,63320,220,NA,NA,I want to turn every secondary school in Australia into a digital school.
200711,63,63320,221,NA,NA,I want to provide every secondary school student with the foundations to move into the digital economy of the future.
200711,63,63320,222,NA,NA,This will not just be a one-off investment.
200711,63,63320,223,NA,NA,And we will fund the replacement of these systems to keep them at the cutting edge.
200711,63,63320,224,NA,NA,"For those schools who have already provided computers for each or most of their students, our plan will enable those schools (government and non government) to upgrade what they already have."
200711,63,63320,225,NA,NA,"Our National Secondary School Computer Fund will help students in all subject areas — such as technical students who use computer aided design as a key part of trades projects including furniture making, carpentry, metals and electronics."
200711,63,63320,226,NA,NA,It will turbo-charge the effective teaching of foreign languages by providing pronunciation drills online.
200711,63,63320,227,NA,NA,"And it will deepen and broaden the study of chemistry, physics, biology and the hard sciences."
200711,63,63320,228,NA,NA,Mr Howard seems to believe that providing our young people with computers is exotic.
200711,63,63320,229,NA,NA,Mr Howard just doesn’t get it.
200711,63,63320,230,NA,NA,"Around the rest of the world, providing young people with computers isn’t exotic — it’s mainstream."
200711,63,63320,231,NA,NA,Mr Howard seems to believe that providing our young people studying the trades with computers is also exotic.
200711,63,63320,232,NA,NA,"Once again, Mr Howard just doesn’t get it."
200711,63,63320,233,NA,NA,"If you visit one of the country’s best tech blocks, or best automotive workshops, you will see how much computers are now increasingly integrated into what we once called the traditional trades."
200711,63,63320,234,NA,NA,I believe that for Australia’s future a trade certificate will be just as important as a university degree.
200711,63,63320,235,NA,NA,The final step in the broadband revolution is to link school networks to students at home.
200711,63,63320,236,NA,NA,"For some students, this happens already."
200711,63,63320,237,NA,NA,"However for many, it doesn’t."
200711,63,63320,238,NA,NA,And one of the purposes of Labor’s Education Tax Refund is to encourage parents to invest in computers and internet connections at home.
200711,63,63320,239,NA,NA,"Because Labor understands that in the 21st century, information technology is not just a key subject to learn, it is now the key to learning all subjects."
200711,63,63320,240,NA,NA,Universities are critical to the education revolution that Australia so urgently needs.
200711,63,63320,241,NA,NA,Australia is the only country in the OECD to have disinvested in our universities in the past decade.
200711,63,63320,242,NA,NA,This has got to stop.
200711,63,63320,243,NA,NA,It has got to stop now.
200711,63,63320,244,NA,NA,Otherwise the brain drain will continue to see us lose many of our brightest young people overseas.
200711,63,63320,245,NA,NA,Undoing the damage which this government has done to our universities will not be easy.
200711,63,63320,246,NA,NA,But this challenge begins today.
200711,63,63320,247,NA,NA,"I announce that if elected, an incoming Labor Government will double the number of national undergraduate scholarships to a total of 88,000 by 2012."
200711,63,63320,248,NA,NA,"I also announce today that if elected an incoming Labor Government will double the number of post graduate scholarships to nearly 10,000 students across Australia by 2012."
200711,63,63320,249,NA,NA,"And if elected we will create for the first time in Australia 1000 high-value mid-career research fellowships, valued at $140,000 each, to help reverse the brain drain."
200711,63,63320,250,NA,NA,This will help retain Australia’s most talented academics at home.
200711,63,63320,251,NA,NA,It will encourage the return of some of our best and brightest from abroad.
200711,63,63320,252,NA,NA,This is critically important economic policy.
200711,63,63320,253,NA,NA,"Australia cannot survive as a knowledge economy if we do not help our universities attract and retain our best scientists, innovators and researchers into the future."
200711,63,63320,254,NA,NA,Today I have announced three new chapters in Labor’s education revolution.
200711,63,63320,255,NA,NA,And we will be building on these chapters into the future.
200711,63,63320,256,NA,NA,I am intensely proud of Labor’s plan for education.
200711,63,63320,257,NA,NA,It’s core business for Labor.
200711,63,63320,258,NA,NA,It’s core business for me.
200711,63,63320,259,NA,NA,And it’s a core part of our nation’s pathway to the future.
200711,63,63320,260,NA,NA,"Friends, it’s good to be back in Brisbane today where I began this election campaign a month ago."
200711,63,63320,261,NA,NA,It’s especially good to be back home with Therese and the kids.
200711,63,63320,262,NA,NA,"And for the record Therese, I haven’t forgotten that today’s our 26th wedding anniversary."
200711,63,63320,263,NA,NA,"Friends, if we are elected in ten days time, I want to be a Prime Minister for all Australians."
200711,63,63320,264,NA,NA,A Prime Minister for Indigenous Australia.
200711,63,63320,265,NA,NA,"A Prime Minister for rural Australia, where so many of our fellow Australians are going through such tough times with the drought."
200711,63,63320,266,NA,NA,A Prime Minister for our regions that stretch so far beyond our magnificent cities.
200711,63,63320,267,NA,NA,"If elected, I also want to ensure that Australia once again has its own voice in the affairs of the world."
200711,63,63320,268,NA,NA,"I want Australia to lead, and not just follow, in dealing with the international challenges of the future."
200711,63,63320,269,NA,NA,"I want Australia to be a leader in the global fight against poverty, disease and underdevelopment — starting right here in our own region, our own neighbourhood, our own backyard."
200711,63,63320,270,NA,NA,And I want Australia to be a leader in the global negotiations on climate change — rather than Australia being excluded from the negotiating table.
200711,63,63320,271,NA,NA,"And on Iraq, the time has come to implement an exit strategy for our combat forces — forces who are needed much closer to home."
200711,63,63320,272,NA,NA,I approach this election with a passionate commitment to Australia’s future.
200711,63,63320,273,NA,NA,The values I bring to leadership are the values instilled in me by my family.
200711,63,63320,274,NA,NA,They are also the values that are intrinsic to this great party.
200711,63,63320,275,NA,NA,I understand that life is sometimes harsh.
200711,63,63320,276,NA,NA,"But I believe that as a community we have a responsibility when one of us falls down, we must help to lift them back up."
200711,63,63320,277,NA,NA,That’s what decency and fairness is all about.
200711,63,63320,278,NA,NA,Another thing I have learnt is the absolute value of hard work.
200711,63,63320,279,NA,NA,Of not being wasteful.
200711,63,63320,280,NA,NA,And the importance of planning for the future.
200711,63,63320,281,NA,NA,"For me, these are enduring values."
200711,63,63320,282,NA,NA,The values that have built Australian families and communities throughout our history.
200711,63,63320,283,NA,NA,And these are the values that as Prime Minister I would bring to our nation’s future challenges.
200711,63,63320,284,NA,NA,I stand before you today as a candidate for the Prime Ministership of Australia.
200711,63,63320,285,NA,NA,I am proud of the plan we have put forward for Australia’s future.
200711,63,63320,286,NA,NA,And I am proud of the team that I lead — the team that will work with me implementing this plan.
200711,63,63320,287,NA,NA,The nation now needs new leadership for the future.
200711,63,63320,288,NA,NA,The nation now wants new leadership for the future.
200711,63,63320,289,NA,NA,"And today, I stand before you ready to deliver that new leadership for Australia’s future."
200711,63,63620,8,NA,NA,I want first of all to say how proud I am to be delivering this speech on behalf of a great and strong and enduring Coalition between the Liberal Party and the National Party.
200711,63,63620,9,NA,NA,"Our two great parties have shared 11 and a half years in office and we have fought for the best interests of the Australian people, wherever they might live, and the speeches you heard earlier from Peter Costello and from Mark Vaile represent the great talent and the great strength of the team that I lead."
200711,63,63620,10,NA,NA,"There are many things that distinguish the Coalition from the Labor Party, but none is more dramatic than the strength of the Coalition team."
200711,63,63620,11,NA,NA,"It’s a blend of the experience of myself and Peter and Alexander who’ve held our positions for 11 and a half years and the great contribution of three successive National Party leaders in Tim Fischer, John Anderson and Mark Vaile, and then in recent times the great contribution being made by new faces in important areas of responsibility and I can think of none better than that because I’m here in Queensland than the great contribution that Mal Brough has made as Minister for Indigenous Affairs."
200711,63,63620,12,NA,NA,"I want to talk to you today, my fellow Australians, about the years ahead of us."
200711,63,63620,13,NA,NA,"This election is about the future of our great nation, not the past, great though that past is, important and treasured it is as it is to all of us, but this is really about the future of our nation and I want to tell you why I believe the Coalition should be returned."
200711,63,63620,14,NA,NA,I want to tell you why I want to be Prime Minister of this country again.
200711,63,63620,15,NA,NA,"I want to share with you my hopes and my dreams for a better future and in the process I hope crystallise very clearly the important choice that must be made on the 24th of November, a choice given new and greater urgency and intensity because of some of the rising challenges on the economic front, both domestically and from abroad."
200711,63,63620,16,NA,NA,I want to be Prime Minister again so that we can build an even stronger and greater Australia.
200711,63,63620,17,NA,NA,We in the Coalition believe that the best years of this nation lie ahead.
200711,63,63620,18,NA,NA,I want to complete the transition of this nation from a welfare state to an opportunity society.
200711,63,63620,19,NA,NA,I want to pursue with relentless vigour the goal of full employment.
200711,63,63620,20,NA,NA,Only the Liberal and National Parties talk about jobs for Australians anymore.
200711,63,63620,21,NA,NA,"Our opponents have given up talking about jobs,"
200711,63,63620,22,NA,NA,except the jobs of the union bosses in a future Labor government.
200711,63,63620,23,NA,NA,"I want to keep inflation low,"
200711,63,63620,24,NA,NA,"I know that Australian families want to do more than just get by on their pay packets, they want to get ahead."
200711,63,63620,25,NA,NA,The Coalition wants to keep taxes as low as possible.
200711,63,63620,26,NA,NA,"Peter Costello and I unveiled a bold plan - five days later, 91.5 per cent of course was adopted by the Australian Labor Party - a bold plan to cut taxes and to encourage Australians to work harder and to re-enter the workforce."
200711,63,63620,27,NA,NA,I want to be Prime Minister again to carry forward my principles and those of the Coalition on education.
200711,63,63620,28,NA,NA,"Australia does not need an education revolution, whatever on earth that might mean; Australia needs an education system that teaches its children to read, to write, to spell and to add up as well as sharing all the technological enhancements that are part of the great learning experience."
200711,63,63620,29,NA,NA,"I want to be Prime Minister again to continue my unconditional, my uncompromising and my unrelenting opposition to the scourge of illicit drug-taking in our nation."
200711,63,63620,30,NA,NA,"Under the Coalition, we will always have a zero tolerance attitude towards drug-taking."
200711,63,63620,31,NA,NA,"We seek your mandate to maintain the strength of Australia,"
200711,63,63620,32,NA,NA,"to maintain the strength of our alliances,"
200711,63,63620,33,1,-1,"to continue the protection of our borders,"
200711,63,63620,34,1,-1,"to continue to decide who comes to this nation,"
200711,63,63620,35,NA,NA,"to continue the great duality of Australian foreign policy over the last 11 and a half years where we have built ever closer relations with our Asian neighbours, yet still remain the great friends and allies of the United States and our other traditional friends."
200711,63,63620,36,NA,NA,We want your support and your votes and your mandate to get the balance right on climate change.
200711,63,63620,37,NA,NA,"We need to have a lower carbon future,"
200711,63,63620,38,NA,NA,"but we need to do it in a way that does not destroy jobs,"
200711,63,63620,39,NA,NA,does not weaken the great coal industry which is so important to the state of Queensland
200711,63,63620,40,NA,NA,and ensures importantly that all nations of the world pull their weight and play their part in contributing to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
200711,63,63620,41,NA,NA,I want to make sure in the future that this is a compassionate nation as well as a prosperous nation.
200711,63,63620,42,NA,NA,I want us to share the benefits of our prosperity to all of those who might otherwise feel excluded.
200711,63,63620,43,NA,NA,"I want rural Australia, our beloved bush, to be an enduring part of the fabric of this nation not only economically but socially."
200711,63,63620,44,NA,NA,"I’ve said before and I’m proud to say it again, I can’t imagine an Australian nation without the bush being an integral part of what it means to be an Australian."
200711,63,63620,45,NA,NA,We in the Coalition want a health system that is more responsive to the needs of families and to local communities
200711,63,63620,46,NA,NA,"and finally, I want to be Prime Minister again so that we can achieve a lasting recognition in our constitution of the first Australians, the indigenous people of this country."
200711,63,63620,47,NA,NA,The Northern Territory intervention has been a veritable watershed in the history of this country.
200711,63,63620,48,NA,NA,"It has brought an end to 20 to 30 years of failure in the area of indigenous policy,"
200711,63,63620,49,NA,NA,"and it offers us the great thing that indigenous people need and that is the opportunity, whilst preserving their special place in the affections and the history of our nation, the opportunity to share its bounty by becoming part of the mainstream of the Australian community."
200711,63,63620,50,NA,NA,"Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve tried in my own words to express to my fellow Australians why it is I’d like you to support the Coalition and why it is I’d like to be Prime Minister of this great country again."
200711,63,63620,51,NA,NA,"We do have a bright future, but that’s not something that can be taken for granted."
200711,63,63620,52,NA,NA,"There are stormclouds gathering on the horizon when it comes to economic management, and if we get it wrong, the prosperity we’ve enjoyed over the last 11 and a half years can be severely compromised."
200711,63,63620,53,NA,NA,"If we elect the wrong people, if we put the Government of this country in the hands of a Ministry 70 per cent of whose members will be former trade union officials, if we choose a Party, the Australian Labor Party that has spent the last ten months smothering all the beliefs and ideals and values it once argued, and turn our backs on the tried and true policies of experience and strength that have brought us the prosperity we now enjoy, our future could be very seriously compromised indeed."
200711,63,63620,54,NA,NA,"We need to continue the leadership that has delivered more than two million new jobs, that has proudly brought Australia’s unemployment rate to a 33-year low, that has seen wages grow by 21 per cent over and above inflation, that has seen the level of industrial disputes fall to the lowest they’ve been since 1913."
200711,63,63620,55,NA,NA,"And I have no hesitation in saying to all of you that I believe our industrial relations reforms have made a mighty contribution to the low unemployment, the low level of strikes and the high real wages that Australians now enjoy."
200711,63,63620,56,NA,NA,"I will, whenever I’m Prime Minister, I will not inflict upon the small businesses of Australia the unfair dismissal laws that will come back if Mr Rudd is elected Prime Minister."
200711,63,63620,57,NA,NA,"And my friends, it isn’t by accident that housing interest rates in Australia today are still only half the notorious peak of 17 per cent that they reached under the former Labor Government."
200711,63,63620,58,NA,NA,These achievements have been no fluke.
200711,63,63620,59,NA,NA,"They’ve been the result of hard work, a consistent policy commitment and a hard-working talented team."
200711,63,63620,60,NA,NA,"And I want to pay particular tribute to the magnificent job that Peter Costello has done over the last 11 and a half years, because he’s been the principal architect of that economic achievement."
200711,63,63620,61,NA,NA,"We have a plan to continue prosperity, we have a plan to drive unemployment even lower."
200711,63,63620,62,NA,NA,"The other side of politics, the Labor Party, has nothing more than a PR script, a script where the people who once opposed tax cuts now support them, the people who once opposed and it was the first thing Mr Rudd voted against when he entered Parliament, a tax break for private health insurance, now supports it, they once opposed the Medicare safety net but now they support it, they once opposed parental choice in education, they now support it, they once opposed Budget surpluses, they now support them."
200711,63,63620,63,NA,NA,"I think you all get the idea, although Peter Garrett didn’t seem to on one occasion."
200711,63,63620,64,NA,NA,It’s a script for a fairly hollow Labor Party led by a man whose core beliefs are obscure and unknown to the Australian public and perhaps to he himself.
200711,63,63620,65,NA,NA,"I said at the start of this election campaign and I say it again here in Brisbane, love me or loathe me, the Australian people know where I stand and what I believe in."
200711,63,63620,66,NA,NA,"I believe in the individual,"
200711,63,63620,67,NA,NA,"I believe in the family as the cornerstone of our happiness and of our nation,"
200711,63,63620,68,NA,NA,"I believe in free enterprise and reward for hard work,"
200711,63,63620,69,NA,NA,"I believe in the values of the old Australia as well as sharing the excitement and the adventure of the new Australia,"
200711,63,63620,70,NA,NA,"I believe very much in the vital role that small business plays in our economy, the two million small businesses that employ some 3.7 million Australians and that the Labor Party wants to return to the clutches of union power."
200711,63,63620,71,NA,NA,Queensland is the quintessential small business state of Australia.
200711,63,63620,72,NA,NA,"Small business makes up 98 per cent of all businesses in Queensland, a Rudd Labor Government on top of a Bligh Labor Government would be lethal for small business here in Queensland."
200711,63,63620,73,NA,NA,"I believe in an outward-looking ambitious self-confident Australia in the world,"
200711,63,63620,74,NA,NA,"I believe in the achievements of the last 11 and a half years, and I want to pay special tribute to the skill and diplomacy and guidance and hard work of Alexander Downer our longest-serving Foreign Minister."
200711,63,63620,75,NA,NA,"Families are the building blocks of a good society and the policies that we’ve developed over the last 11 and a half years, the family tax benefits, the baby bonus and many others, have supported families at every stage of life expanding the horizons of their choices."
200711,63,63620,76,NA,NA,"My opponent talks a great deal about working families, he utters the phrase just about every time he does an interview, but he never seems to talk about what is the source of economic security for working families and that’s work."
200711,63,63620,77,NA,NA,For dad or mum or both in whatever combinations they choose nothing can replace a steady job with rising wages as the basis of family security.
200711,63,63620,78,NA,NA,Today is a very different Australia than the one we inherited when we came to Government 11 and a half years ago.
200711,63,63620,79,NA,NA,"We’re not only talking about the employment opportunities for middle aged and older Australians, for mum and dad."
200711,63,63620,80,NA,NA,"One of the great experiences I’ve personally had in this campaign, and I had it again last Friday in Penrith in Western Sydney, was to talk to scores of young people who’ve just finished school and are literally bubbling over enthusiasm about getting into the labour market knowing that they can confidently not only get a job but also get the job they want."
200711,63,63620,81,NA,NA,"What has struck me is this great sense of optimism, this 33-year low in unemployment."
200711,63,63620,82,NA,NA,I just feel so tremendously proud that I’m privileged to be the Prime Minister of a country that has given them that opportunity.
200711,63,63620,83,NA,NA,"I think of how people 15 and 20 years ago in that same age cohort left school with hesitancy and pessimism and with little hope about getting a job, let alone the job that they wanted."
200711,63,63620,84,NA,NA,And I don’t think there is anything more important for all of us than to preserve that sense of hope and enthusiasm and optimism amongst our young for years into the future.
200711,63,63620,85,NA,NA,Today I want to talk about a number of initiatives that are part of the next chapter of our plans to put more power into the hands of individuals and families rather than governments and bureaucracies.
200711,63,63620,86,NA,NA,"It’s a plan that speaks to Australians of all ages,"
200711,63,63620,87,NA,NA,while recognising that each generation faces unique challenges in their own time.
200711,63,63620,88,NA,NA,It evokes the timeless hopes and dreams that transcend generations of Australians.
200711,63,63620,89,NA,NA,"They include the desire for a good job, the impulse to raise a family and to give one’s children the best possible start in life, the urge to self-improvement, to education and the desire ultimately for a place called home."
200711,63,63620,90,NA,NA,"The home being an almost sacred part of the Australian Liberal creed stretching back to Menzies’ memorable evocation of homes material, homes human and homes spiritual in the forgotten peoples speech of 1942."
200711,63,63620,91,NA,NA,And what unites our creed of optimism is the belief that the Australian people do not need governments instructing them about virtue.
200711,63,63620,92,NA,NA,They are more than capable of charting their own course towards a good life for themselves and for their families.
200711,63,63620,93,NA,NA,"And today I want to announce three new measures that go to the decisions that matter most to families: the care of children in early years, parents’ investment in their children’s education and the dream of home ownership."
200711,63,63620,94,NA,NA,"In 2004, we introduced the childcare tax rebate to provide extra financial help for families covering 30 per cent of out of pocket expenses."
200711,63,63620,95,NA,NA,"Today, families can claim up to $4,354 per child a year for out of pocket expenses."
200711,63,63620,96,NA,NA,"We have continued to look at how we can ensure the amount of money parents have to pay upfront is reduced and so, a re-elected Coalition Government will pay families childcare tax rebate in advance to the childcare provider ensuring fees are reduced before parents pay."
200711,63,63620,97,NA,NA,This should cut the upfront cost for families by 30 per cent.
200711,63,63620,98,NA,NA,"As a result, more than 500,000 families will have their current childcare costs dramatically reduced, and families will see the benefit of reduced fees from the first of April 2008."
200711,63,63620,99,NA,NA,We will also increase the number of childcare places in areas of greatest need.
200711,63,63620,100,NA,NA,We will provide capital funding to local governments of up to $1 million to build or extend childcare centres in the areas where there are no vacancies.
200711,63,63620,101,NA,NA,"Together with our goal of full employment, building a culture of savings and home ownership is a big part of Australia making the transition from a welfare state to an opportunity society."
200711,63,63620,102,NA,NA,"The Coalition is committed to Australia remaining a great home-owning society, indeed one of the greatest in the world, where the dream of home ownership remains at the heart of the Australian experience and within reach of each successive generation."
200711,63,63620,103,NA,NA,Today I announce new measures to assist Australians looking to get a foot in the door of their first home.
200711,63,63620,104,NA,NA,This is a comprehensive plan to make home ownership more affordable for young Australians by boosting their capacity to save for a home.
200711,63,63620,105,NA,NA,"From 2008-09, a re-elected Coalition government will introduce tax-free home savings accounts for all Australians who have yet to own their first home."
200711,63,63620,106,NA,NA,"Contributions of up to $1,000 a year will be tax deductible, all interest and earnings from the accounts will completely free of tax."
200711,63,63620,107,NA,NA,"Under our plan, as it applies to Australians under 18 years of age, parents, grandparents and others will be able to contribute up to $1,000 between them each year to a tax-free home savings account for children."
200711,63,63620,108,NA,NA,Savings will be accessible to purchase a first home once the account holder turns the age of 18.
200711,63,63620,109,NA,NA,"For Australians aged 18 and over, a maximum of $10,000 a year can be contributed to a tax- free savings account for adults with only the account-holder eligible to claim a tax deduction of up to $1,000 for their contribution."
200711,63,63620,110,NA,NA,Child accounts will become adult accounts when the account holder turns 18.
200711,63,63620,111,NA,NA,"In the case of adult accounts, the account holder will be able to withdraw their account balance to buy their first home at any time after the age of 18."
200711,63,63620,112,NA,NA,"I can also announce today that a re-elected Coalition Government will, subject to economic conditions and the state of the Budget, look to make contributions from future Budget surpluses to these tax-free home savings accounts."
200711,63,63620,113,NA,NA,These accounts will help young Australians to develop the habits of saving and managing money
200711,63,63620,114,NA,NA,and today we are also releasing a policy to build on the fine work of the Financial Literary Foundation chaired by Paul Clitheroe to give all Australians access to accurate independent information on money matters.
200711,63,63620,115,NA,NA,"Evidence from around the world shows that a culture of saving and home ownership, even among families on modest incomes, is associated with an orientation towards the future: household stability, stable marriages, steady employment, educational attainment, healthy lifestyles and local civic involvement."
200711,63,63620,116,NA,NA,"This is the essence of the opportunity society I want Australia to become, where people are encouraged to work hard, save and look after their families and contribute to their communities."
200711,63,63620,117,NA,NA,"In addition, capital gains tax will be removed for Australians who share equity in a family member’s first home."
200711,63,63620,118,NA,NA,This will facilitate the desire of a lot of parents to assist their children in buying their first home through a shared equity arrangement.
200711,63,63620,119,NA,NA,"To further assist with housing affordability in the near term, I am today announcing a series of new measures that tackle the supply problems of housing affordability."
200711,63,63620,120,NA,NA,"A re-elected Coalition Government will expedite the disposal of Commonwealth land, totalling 961 hectares in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT, following the recent Commonwealth audit of land holdings."
200711,63,63620,121,NA,NA,A further impediment to more Australians owning their own home is State and local government infrastructure charges that inflate the price of house and land packages.
200711,63,63620,122,NA,NA,"As a result, home buyers are often paying for infrastructure that benefits the wider community and should therefore be paid for by the wider community."
200711,63,63620,123,NA,NA,"To tackle this problem, a re-elected Coalition government will commit $500 million over three years to fund on a 50/50 cost share basis with State and local governments common-use community infrastructure associated with new developments and urban consolidation."
200711,63,63620,124,NA,NA,"This could include community halls, libraries and sporting grounds."
200711,63,63620,125,NA,NA,"Funding will be on a competitive basis and subject to criteria, such as demonstrated improvements in approval processes."
200711,63,63620,126,NA,NA,Let me now turn to the crucial area of education.
200711,63,63620,127,NA,NA,"The Coalition has a distinctive approach to education policy, with a clear focus on choice, high standards and greater national consistency."
200711,63,63620,128,NA,NA,"Unlike our opponents, we have never had hit-lists of independent schools."
200711,63,63620,129,NA,NA,"Unlike our opponents, we have always believed in the unconditional right of Australian parents to choose the nature and the quality of the education they want for their children."
200711,63,63620,130,NA,NA,We are unashamedly the parties of parental school choice.
200711,63,63620,131,NA,NA,"The blossoming of low-fee independent schools in the last decade, which we have supported, has given many families for the first time real choice over the school to which they send their child."
200711,63,63620,132,NA,NA,Choice is a vehicle for driving better school performance across the board because it empowers the consumers of education services and that’s the students and the parents.
200711,63,63620,133,NA,NA,Today I announce a policy that will further increase choice and improve education opportunities by helping parents make the investments in their children’s future that matter so much.
200711,63,63620,134,NA,NA,"I know that for many parents this is the most important investment of all but, of course, they face many competing pressures on the family budget and so a re-elected Coalition Government will introduce a new tax rebate for education expenses including, crucially, school fees."
200711,63,63620,135,NA,NA,"This will apply for every student, beginning with preschool – that’s kindergarten in some States – until the end of secondary school."
200711,63,63620,136,NA,NA,Parents will be refunded up to $400 annually for each child at primary or preschool and they will be refunded up to $800 annually for each secondary school student.
200711,63,63620,137,NA,NA,This initiative has four key features.
200711,63,63620,138,NA,NA,"First, it is broad."
200711,63,63620,139,NA,NA,It will apply to a wide range of education expenses including all school fees and the so-called voluntary contributions and levies that have increasingly crept into government education systems.
200711,63,63620,140,NA,NA,"It will also cover school text books, uniforms, camps and excursions, as well as extra costs of elective subjects like music and drama."
200711,63,63620,141,NA,NA,"And, of course, it will cover tools to help our children learn, like laptops and broadband connections."
200711,63,63620,142,NA,NA,"Unlike Mr Rudd, I do recognise that the costs of education extend well beyond laptops and broadband connections."
200711,63,63620,143,NA,NA,"Second, this rebate recognises that our children’s education begins before school."
200711,63,63620,144,NA,NA,"The importance of early childhood learning to later life outcomes is well known, which is why we have deliberately structured this initiative to include the costs of children attending government, community and private preschools, or kindergartens in some States, in the year before they commence formal schooling."
200711,63,63620,145,NA,NA,"Thirdly, this measure recognises the higher costs of educating older students."
200711,63,63620,146,NA,NA,This will be a refundable tax rebate of 40% for expenses up to a maximum of $2000 per secondary school student and up to a maximum of $1000 per student at primary or preschool.
200711,63,63620,147,NA,NA,"And finally, let me emphasise that all Australian families will benefit from the full value of this rebate irrespective of their income."
200711,63,63620,148,NA,NA,"This rebate is very much about practical assistance to help parents make the best possible choices for their children’s future,"
200711,63,63620,149,NA,NA,so that Australia’s children can have the best possible start in life.
200711,63,63620,150,NA,NA,"My friends, I commenced my remarks in speaking of how the choice on the 24th of November had very much crystallised around the issue of economic management."
200711,63,63620,151,NA,NA,"The economy isn’t everything in life, we all know that, but a strong economy is central to the capacity of this nation to deliver the things that we all want."
200711,63,63620,152,NA,NA,"I think back over the last 11 and a half years and I recall how we’ve been able to rebuild the defence forces of this country and how very proud I felt a few weeks ago to go to Enoggera, not far from here, and announce that the trigger point for the establishment of the second of the new battalions that we’re able to raise had been reached."
200711,63,63620,153,NA,NA,And how recruitment levels into the armed forces had grown despite the fact that we have a near full-employment economy.
200711,63,63620,154,NA,NA,And I’m very proud to say that one of the greatest achievements of this Government has been to increase by no less than 47% in real terms the amount of money that we spend on defence.
200711,63,63620,155,NA,NA,And we all know what a wonderful job the men and women of the Australian Defence Force have done for us over the past years and what tremendous service they render in our name and in the name of our nation in many trouble spots around the world.
200711,63,63620,156,NA,NA,"But whether it’s defence, whether it’s roads, whether it’s education or whether it’s health, it’s all being made possible because we have built a strong economy."
200711,63,63620,157,NA,NA,Never forget what we inherited.
200711,63,63620,158,NA,NA,Never forget the $96 billion of debt.
200711,63,63620,159,NA,NA,Never forget the 8.2% of unemployment.
200711,63,63620,160,NA,NA,Never forget that interest rates reached 17% under the former Government.
200711,63,63620,161,NA,NA,"Never forget that we were told by our opponents that the leaders of Asia would not deal with this country,"
200711,63,63620,162,NA,NA,"and yet eleven-and-a-half years later we have achieved what I call this remarkable duality in foreign policy - a close, enduring relationship with our great ally, the United States, but side by side with that we have built a constructive and enduring relationship with the fastest growing nation in the world, China."
200711,63,63620,163,NA,NA,"The Australian Labor Party wants the Australian people to believe that the Australian economy is on autopilot, that it just happens automatically, it’s all due to the resources boom, it’s got nothing to do with the quality of the people in charge."
200711,63,63620,164,NA,NA,They want to sort of slip by unnoticed.
200711,63,63620,165,NA,NA,They want their past record to be consigned to oblivion.
200711,63,63620,166,NA,NA,They don’t want to be reminded that they opposed all of the reforms that have built the prosperity that we now have.
200711,63,63620,167,NA,NA,"We have an obligation, we in the Coalition, not to let the Labor Party get away with that deceit."
200711,63,63620,168,NA,NA,And I want to say to all of my fellow Australians that the choice you face on the 24th of November has become more intense and more urgent because of some of the stormclouds that are gathering on our economy both domestically and internationally.
200711,63,63620,169,NA,NA,"With the right leadership, the skill that people like Peter Costello have displayed over the last eleven-and-a-half years, we can continue to see it grow."
200711,63,63620,170,NA,NA,We can reach that great goal of full employment.
200711,63,63620,171,NA,NA,We can once again walk the shopping malls and the streets of this nation and meet enthusiastic young people bubbling with hope and pride and confidence about their future job prospects.
200711,63,63620,172,NA,NA,"But if we get it wrong, if we hand it over to inexperienced people, a government dominated by 70% of former trade union officials, if we have a nation for the first time in its history with a Labor Government at every level, coast to coast, wall to wall without lead or hindrance, isn’t that a huge risk – isn’t that taking too big a risk with the prosperity that we have worked so hard to build?"
200711,63,63620,173,NA,NA,"My fellow Australians, it has been an incredible privilege to be the Prime Minister of the greatest country in the world, but there is much to do in the future."
200711,63,63620,174,NA,NA,There is much work ahead of us.
200711,63,63620,175,NA,NA,There are great responsibilities to be discharged.
200711,63,63620,176,NA,NA,I ask for your support and your votes to continue the great work of the last eleven-and-a-half years on the 24th of November.
200711,63,63810,9,NA,NA,Australia today is a nation of confident and optimistic people.
200711,63,63810,10,NA,NA,It hasn’t always been that way.
200711,63,63810,11,NA,NA,"In the past 11 years, that confidence and optimism has grown under the strong management of our Coalition Government."
200711,63,63810,12,NA,NA,"In that time, Australians have come to feel more secure."
200711,63,63810,13,NA,NA,- More secure within our borders.
200711,63,63810,14,NA,NA,- More secure within our economy.
200711,63,63810,15,NA,NA,- More secure within their jobs.
200711,63,63810,16,NA,NA,"Now that we have a strong economy; now that we have more people in full-time work than at any other time in Australia’s history, we need to lock it in."
200711,63,63810,17,NA,NA,An optimistic and confident Australia now needs a strong plan for the future
200711,63,63810,18,NA,NA,– and we need to keep our nation in safe hands.
200711,63,63810,19,NA,NA,Our strong plan includes aiming for a full employment economy.
200711,63,63810,20,NA,NA,An economy where every Australian who wants a job can get one.
200711,63,63810,21,NA,NA,"Our strong plan is about guiding our nation through the challenges that lie ahead,"
200711,63,63810,22,NA,NA,while helping all Australians to share in the opportunities and benefits that come from a well managed economy.
200711,63,63810,23,NA,NA,"We must ensure that these opportunities and benefits are available to all Australians, including the 7.5 million people living outside our capital cities."
200711,63,63810,24,NA,NA,Better health care for rural and remote communities
200711,63,63810,25,NA,NA,We know that families across Australia want better health care.
200711,63,63810,26,NA,NA,In particular they want better services from their public hospital system.
200711,63,63810,27,NA,NA,I want to reiterate our commitment to appointing local hospital boards.
200711,63,63810,28,NA,NA,We want public hospitals to be controlled by men and women who know the hospital staff and know the patients and have a personal commitment to the health of their community.
200711,63,63810,29,NA,NA,"Local boards will have more control of their hospitals, making it harder for State Labor Governments to downgrade hospital services in rural and regional areas."
200711,63,63810,30,NA,NA,"While we will give control of hospitals back to local people, Labor wants to replace the state bureaucrats running hospitals with federal bureaucrats who would be even more remote from doctors, nurses, and their patients."
200711,63,63810,31,NA,NA,The Coalition Government has worked hard to attract medical professionals to rural and regional areas.
200711,63,63810,32,NA,NA,One of the impediments is sourcing relief locums when specialists need time off or time to upgrade their professional skills.
200711,63,63810,33,NA,NA,The Coalition Government has put a scheme in place to provide locums for specialist obstetricians in rural areas.
200711,63,63810,34,NA,NA,The scheme was due to end in 2009.
200711,63,63810,35,NA,NA,"I am announcing today that we will extend the scheme into the future, because it has been highly successful in helping specialist obstetricians to stay in the country where they are needed and where they want to practice."
200711,63,63810,36,NA,NA,The Coalition will also provide extra training support for doctors in rural areas who carry out medical procedures.
200711,63,63810,37,NA,NA,I am announcing today that we will commit $15 million to establish a new Rural and Remote Medical Training Equipment Fund.
200711,63,63810,38,NA,NA,The funding will purchase and distribute training simulators and support equipment that will be used to train doctors to treat conditions that they may only see occasionally in the day to day operations of their practice.
200711,63,63810,39,NA,NA,This programme will allow rural GPs to keep their skills up to date
200711,63,63810,40,NA,NA,and help deliver better services for rural people.
200711,63,63810,42,NA,NA,"One of the best ways we can spread Australia's prosperity is to make sure that every Australian student gets a good education, including vocational training or university after they leave school."
200711,63,63810,43,NA,NA,It's good for the individual and it’s good for the country: we need more people with technical and vocational skills in our economy.
200711,63,63810,44,NA,NA,A re-elected Coalition will deliver a core national curriculum.
200711,63,63810,45,NA,NA,We will deliver certainty and national standards that all schools must meet.
200711,63,63810,46,NA,NA,Australians don’t want a risky “education revolution”.
200711,63,63810,47,NA,NA,It sounds like something that might happen in a Communist country.
200711,63,63810,48,NA,NA,We will make sure opportunities exist in both the country and the city.
200711,63,63810,49,NA,NA,Students in remote areas don’t need a revolution – they just need a bit of help.
200711,63,63810,50,NA,NA,These students often face an insurmountable barrier to continuing their education; it’s the tyranny of distance.
200711,63,63810,51,NA,NA,Their families cannot afford the cost of sending them to live in a distant city to pursue educational opportunities.
200711,63,63810,52,NA,NA,A re-elected Coalition Government will help these families.
200711,63,63810,53,NA,NA,"I am announcing today that we will provide 1,000 students per year in remote Australia with $4,000 bursaries to help them participate in higher education – either university or vocational education and training."
200711,63,63810,54,NA,NA,"Students will have to apply for the bursaries; they will be allocated to the 1,000 students who need them most."
200711,63,63810,55,NA,NA,The Remote Students Bursary scheme will start on 1 July 2008.
200711,63,63810,56,NA,NA,This is a key part of our strong plan for ensuring all Australians share in the prosperity of the nation.
200711,63,63810,58,NA,NA,"Our strong economic management has given us the ability to take on the great challenges that Australia is facing, including the drought."
200711,63,63810,59,NA,NA,"The Coalition Government has now committed $3.5 billion in drought assistance, which is helping more than 40,000 farming families and small businesses."
200711,63,63810,60,NA,NA,We have the strong plan and the safe hands to maintain Australia's strong economy.
200711,63,63810,61,NA,NA,We will spread its benefits to every street and every family.
200711,63,63810,62,NA,NA,We will ensure we share our prosperity with the people who have built this nation.
200711,63,63810,63,NA,NA,That’s why we will increase the utilities allowance for older Australians to help meet basic household bills like power and gas.
200711,63,63810,64,NA,NA,For the first time we will extend the utilities allowance to carers and disability support pensioners
200711,63,63810,65,NA,NA,and double the senior’s concession allowance to help self-funded retirees with cost of living pressures.
200711,63,63810,67,NA,NA,Our strong plan for the future includes an integrated vision for improving local roads and national highways to meet our future transport needs.
200711,63,63810,68,NA,NA,We have now committed record amounts of funding:
200711,63,63810,69,NA,NA,- to fix the nation’s highways
200711,63,63810,70,NA,NA,- to fix the major urban road networks
200711,63,63810,71,NA,NA,- to fix the strategic regional roads network; and
200711,63,63810,72,NA,NA,- to fix the local roads network.
200711,63,63810,73,NA,NA,At last we can afford to invest in infrastructure that will drive growth and create jobs.
200711,63,63810,74,NA,NA,Our plan will develop a safe and efficient transport network:
200711,63,63810,75,NA,NA,- a network that is safe for mums and dads doing the school run.
200711,63,63810,76,NA,NA,"- a network that allows our industries to efficiently move goods around the country,"
200711,63,63810,77,NA,NA,- and at the same time eliminate millions of truck movements from our urban roads.
200711,63,63810,78,NA,NA,Many Australian families today are concerned about the rising cost of fuel.
200711,63,63810,79,NA,NA,It's not only a problem for families: it's a challenge for our whole country.
200711,63,63810,80,NA,NA,"The vast size of this nation means everything we do – from driving to work, to moving our exports to port has a transport cost."
200711,63,63810,81,NA,NA,The Coalition believes that we need to source more of our fuel from crops grown in Australia.
200711,63,63810,82,NA,NA,We believe we should be using more green fuel in Australia.
200711,63,63810,83,NA,NA,We have made a good start but there is a lot more to be done.
200711,63,63810,84,NA,NA,Australia's production of biofuels is expected to increase from 106 million litres in 2006 to 217 million litres in 2007.
200711,63,63810,85,NA,NA,"It is on track to reach the Government's production target, which is 350 million litres per year by 2010."
200711,63,63810,86,NA,NA,We need to make biofuels available to more Australians.
200711,63,63810,87,NA,NA,"Today, I am announcing a strong plan to increase Australia's biofuel production and to encourage more Australians to choose biofuels at the fuel pump."
200711,63,63810,88,NA,NA,The number of service stations selling ethanol blended fuel has increased from 70 in 2005 – just after the Labor Party had demonised ethanol as a green fuel – now we have 800 outlets across the nation.
200711,63,63810,89,NA,NA,We want to see more.
200711,63,63810,90,NA,NA,A re-elected Coalition Government will extend the Ethanol Distribution Programme until June 2009.
200711,63,63810,91,NA,NA,"We expect that an extra 400 service stations will take up the $20,000 grants to help convert to selling ethanol blended fuel."
200711,63,63810,92,NA,NA,"The Coalition's biofuel plan is good news for the family budget, because ethanol blended fuel is about 3 cents per litre cheaper than ordinary unleaded petrol."
200711,63,63810,93,NA,NA,"It's good news for Australia, because it reduces our dependence on imported fuel."
200711,63,63810,94,NA,NA,"And it's good news for the environment, because it reduces our greenhouse gas emissions."
200711,63,63810,95,NA,NA,That is why today I am also announcing that a re-elected Coalition Government will commit a further $5 million to work with the biofuels industry to make more Australians aware of these benefits and to drive demand.
200711,63,63810,97,NA,NA,"At the moment, ethanol is produced from food crops like wheat, corn and sugar."
200711,63,63810,98,NA,NA,"But the race is on to find a way to make ethanol in commercial quantities from plant waste like sugar cane bagasse, crop stubble, and sawmill residue."
200711,63,63810,99,NA,NA,It's called lignocellulosic ethanol.
200711,63,63810,100,NA,NA,"The Coalition Government will continue to support research into these second generation biofuels, by providing $5 million to support further research and development."
200711,63,63810,101,NA,NA,The Coalition will also fund a $6 million trial to test whether biodiesel meets heavy vehicle diesel standards – a key step towards driving a future biodiesel industry.
200711,63,63810,102,NA,NA,Heavy vehicles account for 40 per cent of Australia's diesel consumption and the trial will test whether the B20 biodiesel blend can meet the diesel fuel standard.
200711,63,63810,103,NA,NA,Australia needs an experienced team with safe hands.
200711,63,63810,104,NA,NA,We have a strong plan for the future
200711,63,63810,105,NA,NA,"and the safe, experienced hands to deliver it."
200711,63,63810,106,NA,NA,The case for the re-election of the Coalition Government is compelling.
200711,63,63810,107,NA,NA,We have established the strongest economic platform this nation has ever stood on – a $1.1 trillion economy.
200711,63,63810,108,NA,NA,We have established the strongest employment platform this nation has ever experienced – 10.5 million people in work.
200711,63,63810,109,NA,NA,We have had an unprecedented 16 years of continuous economic expansion.
200711,63,63810,110,NA,NA,The Coalition has a strong plan for the nation’s future.

201008,63,63810,112,NA,NA,Our policy approach has four elements as follows.
201008,63,63810,113,NA,NA,"Guaranteeing Regional Service Delivery Under Labor governments, State and Federal, country hospitals have been closed or downgraded, schools and public buildings neglected, infrastructure left to run down, and services downgraded or withdrawn."
201008,63,63810,114,NA,NA,The Nationals will ensure that a Fair Share of Australian Government funding for infrastructure and services is allocated to regional areas.
201008,63,63810,115,NA,NA,"Where appropriate, the Commonwealth will impose specific obligations in financial agreements with the States for an identified proportion of funding to be allocated to regional areas."
201008,63,63810,116,NA,NA,"We also believe that the effects of government decisions on regional communities need to be taken into account, as part of the decision making process."
201008,63,63810,117,NA,NA,"The Nationals believe that all Cabinet submissions should be accompanied by a Regional Impact Statement, outlining the economic, environmental and social consequences of government decisions on regional Australia."
201008,63,63810,119,NA,NA,"Regional Development Australia must be made responsive to local communities, and be able to build partnerships between government and those communities."
201008,63,63810,120,NA,NA,"The Nationals will establish local committees, comprising local leaders drawn from the community, business and government, to set the direction of each Regional Development Australia office."
201008,63,63810,121,NA,NA,Committee members will be responsible for working with regional stakeholders to prepare plans which identify strategies to strengthen the region.
201008,63,63810,122,NA,NA,"Working with State and local governments, universities, service organisations, cultural groups, sporting clubs, business and community leaders, each Regional Development Australia office will be required to assess local needs and identify targeted initiatives to support growth."
201008,63,63810,123,NA,NA,"The restructured Regional Development Australia network will provide a gateway to Federal Government funding programs via our Fair Share commitment,"
201008,63,63810,124,NA,NA,"including a restructured Better Regions Program, to support local projects and initiatives."
201008,63,63810,125,NA,NA,"The Nationals will restructure the Regional Development Australia National Advisory Council to make it truly representative of the regions, and able to make meaningful contributions to regional policy development."
201008,63,63810,126,NA,NA,The new committee will have direct access to senior Ministers and will be consulted on key policy initiatives.
201008,63,63810,128,NA,NA,The need for special assistance for regions facing major structural adjustment as a result of unexpected demographic or economic change has continued under the Labor Government.
201008,63,63810,129,NA,NA,"However, Labor policies such as buying irrigation properties are adding to social and economic trauma."
201008,63,63810,130,NA,NA,The need for a Sustainable Regions Program remains.
201008,63,63810,131,NA,NA,"The Nationals will restore a Sustainable Regions Program in areas of Australia facing specific economic, environmental and social challenges."
201008,63,63810,132,NA,NA,"The program will be designed to support projects which create employment or establish new businesses, through partnerships between the private sector, government and the community."
201008,63,63810,133,NA,NA,"Each region will have its own advisory panel comprising business, community and local leaders, who will consult with the community to determine the economic, community and social priorities for the region, and act as a first filter for potential projects."
201008,63,63810,135,NA,NA,"The Nationals will broaden the Better Regions Program –a corrupted Labor version of the former Regional Partnerships program – to provide funding for community projects supported by partnership funds from State and local governments, the community, private enterprise and individuals."
201008,63,63810,136,NA,NA,All applications will undergo rigorous assessment.
201008,63,63810,137,NA,NA,"The Better Regions Program will have three components: infrastructure project grants for large scale industry, tourism, community infrastructure and community service proposals;"
201008,63,63810,138,NA,NA,"community grants for initiatives that increase social opportunities, community participation and interaction;"
201008,63,63810,139,NA,NA,and a range of small grants to help councils and not-for-profit organisations with minor community projects.
201008,63,63810,141,NA,NA,The Nationals have a proud record of achieving results in regional development. This policy builds on our past achievements and sets a bold new direction for supporting regional development.  Its key themes are:
201008,63,63810,142,NA,NA,Recognition of the need for non-negotiable provision of best practice services and infrastructure for regions;
201008,63,63810,143,NA,NA,Decentralisation of decision- making for regional planning;
201008,63,63810,144,NA,NA,Support for innovation in the regions; and
201008,63,63810,145,NA,NA,Better funding models to enable regions to achieve their vision.
201008,63,63810,146,NA,NA,Our policy promotes the provision of adequate services and first class infrastructure for all regions.
201008,63,63810,147,NA,NA,It will place far greater emphasis on regional innovation and entrepreneurship as the key drivers of successful regional development.
201008,63,63810,148,NA,NA,"It will create new opportunities for region-wide, bottom-up economic development."
201008,63,63810,149,NA,NA,The Nationals recognise the limits of any government’s capacity to control all the forces that drive regional outcomes.
201008,63,63810,150,NA,NA,We realise that the regions themselves must take responsibility for development strategies.
201008,63,63810,151,NA,NA,We understand that regional development institutions must be properly resourced and given the freedom to make their own decisions.
201008,63,63810,152,NA,NA,"The Nationals will encourage regions to drive their own futures through new, bold and highly innovative funding mechanisms and governance frameworks to deliver a better and more prosperous future for regional Australia."
201008,63,63810,156,NA,NA,Australians consistently identify health policy as their most important concern.
201008,63,63810,157,NA,NA,Demands made on the public health system continue to rise as people live longer and new medical technologies become available.
201008,63,63810,158,NA,NA,"Services become over-burdened, health personnel are in short supply, and some local health authorities are so under-funded by State Labor governments that they are unable to pay their bills."
201008,63,63810,159,NA,NA,"Regional Australians struggle with reduced access to services and fewer health professionals while suffering higher rates of disease, more injuries and higher mortality rates."
201008,63,63810,160,NA,NA,"They find fewer obstetrics beds or aged care facilities, travel greater distances for radiotherapy, and have scant access to mental health services and less continuity of medical and nursing staff."
201008,63,63810,161,NA,NA,"Medicare, which was meant to treat people equally and fairly, spends considerably more in metropolitan areas than in regional areas, despite many regional areas having considerably worse health outcomes and greater need."
201008,63,63810,162,NA,NA,Only The Nationals’ Regional Health Rescue Plan can ensure that the one third of Australians living in the regions get a fair go from the health system and a fair share of health funding.
201008,63,63810,164,NA,NA,Labor promised at the last Federal election to ‘fix’ health by mid-2009.
201008,63,63810,165,NA,NA,"Instead, the Government has ensured that Federal money will flow into State bureaucracies rather than delivering genuine reform of the system."
201008,63,63810,166,NA,NA,"Saddled with huge deficits and a looming net debt of $94 billion, Labor is breaking every promise it made about health in the 2007 election campaign."
201008,63,63810,167,NA,NA,"Australians will pay more for health care as a result of the government winding back the private health insurance rebate, Medicare Safety Net, pathology and diagnostic services, and reducing Medicare fees to some regional doctors."
201008,63,63810,168,NA,NA,"Initially greeted as a ‘bright spot’ in the health budget, the vaunted increase in spending on regional health is found to be a smoke screen."
201008,63,63810,169,NA,NA,Increased incentives for doctors to practise in regions are not attractive enough to entice them.
201008,63,63810,170,NA,NA,"A change from the Regional, Remote and Metropolitan Areas (RRMA) classification system to the geographic classification system is producing anomalies, winners and losers."
201008,63,63810,171,NA,NA,The Prime Minister even countenances smaller rural hospitals “providing lesser levels of service” under his plan.
201008,63,63810,172,NA,NA,"Many smaller programs within the health portfolio have been cut back in the Government’s search for savings, and regional communities have borne the brunt."

201008,63,63810,181,NA,NA,Regional health deserves a higher profile in the overall health policy of government.
201008,63,63810,182,NA,NA,"When health policy decisions are being made, regional concerns must be championed by a dedicated Minister with regional experience and a primary focus on the welfare of regional Australians."
201008,63,63810,183,NA,NA,"The Minister for Regional Health will give full-time attention to regional health concerns, and win for regional health a high priority in general health policy."
201008,63,63810,184,NA,NA,The first task will be to take the wide and often confusing array of programs for improving regional health and integrate them into a single policy.
201008,63,63810,185,NA,NA,The Nationals will strengthen the Ministerial role by providing a specific regional unit within the Health Department.
201008,63,63810,187,NA,NA,"The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission (NHHRC) has recommended that “funding equivalent to national average medical benefits and primary health care service funding, appropriately adjusted for remoteness and health status, be made available for local service provision where populations are underserved,” at an estimated maximum cost of $143 million."
201008,63,63810,188,NA,NA,"The Nationals will provide increased financial support for doctors who provide health services in regional and remote communities, through increased Medicare rebates and scheduled fees loaded on top of regular Medicare billings which will increase according to remoteness."
201008,63,63810,189,NA,NA,We will engage with the relevant medical colleges to determine an appropriate scheduled Medicare fee for particular services delivered in regional and remote Australia.
201008,63,63810,190,NA,NA,The financial benefits of regional practice will become more apparent and accessible.
201008,63,63810,191,NA,NA,This program will include allied health workers and nurses to attract the full range of health professionals to regional areas.
201008,63,63810,192,NA,NA,Medicare is too urban- and too doctor-centric.
201008,63,63810,193,NA,NA,Medicare benefits per person in capital cities are one sixth higher than in rural and remote areas.
201008,63,63810,194,NA,NA,Medicare access to allied health services is restricted in regional areas that lack GPs.
201008,63,63810,195,NA,NA,"In areas which have allied health professionals but lack GPs, The Nationals will allow Medicare claims for these services without a doctor’s referral, helping to redress the imbalance in Medicare billings."
201008,63,63810,197,NA,NA,"Regional hospitals are continually being downgraded, to the point that they cannot meet the demands of the communities they serve."
201008,63,63810,198,NA,NA,"Much health service delivery operates through health bodies run by the States, and many decisions for regional areas are made by central bureaucracies in the State capitals."
201008,63,63810,199,NA,NA,"The Nationals will provide guaranteed service levels for key regional hospitals in such fields as maternity, mental health, accident and emergency and public dentistry."
201008,63,63810,200,NA,NA,"The Nationals will establish Local Hospital Boards for the larger public hospitals – and also for groups of smaller hospitals, if their communities want them."
201008,63,63810,201,NA,NA,These Local Hospital Boards will ensure that local hospitals meet local needs.
201008,63,63810,202,NA,NA,They will be funded directly by the Commonwealth and accountable to their community.
201008,63,63810,203,NA,NA,"Under our plan, communities will be provided with information on how their local hospitals are performing and the ability to achieve the outcomes they want."
201008,63,63810,204,NA,NA,The Nationals will not support policies which lead to the closure of regional hospitals.
201008,63,63810,205,NA,NA,Any such decisions by the Rudd Government will be reversed by The Nationals in government.
201008,63,63810,207,NA,NA,The Nationals will provide funding for more aged care beds in regional areas.
201008,63,63810,208,NA,NA,The same emphasis on funding and performance as proposed for regional hospitals will apply to aged care facilities. Incentives will be provided for regional health professionals to broaden their skills to provide expert care of the elderly.
201008,63,63810,209,NA,NA,The Nationals’ policy will ensure maximum co-operation and efficiencies between Government and nongovernment organisations.
201008,63,63810,211,NA,NA,"The Nationals will establish a targeted regional health fund as part of our “Fair Share” commitment, to provide funding for new regional health services, and incentives to attract and retain medical professionals in the regions."
201008,63,63810,212,NA,NA,We will ensure that funding for regional health priorities is permanent and ‘ring-fenced’.
201008,63,63810,213,NA,NA,Regional health practitioners will be able to rely on funding support.
201008,63,63810,215,NA,NA,"In a typical regional medical practice, doctors face the stress of managing a small business as well as their medical responsibilities."
201008,63,63810,216,NA,NA,"General Practitioners in a regional setting must buy or establish their practice, and, when they leave, sell the practice."
201008,63,63810,217,NA,NA,This added responsibility discourages many GPs from practising in the regions.
201008,63,63810,218,NA,NA,"Many medical professionals prefer to be employees rather than managers, and to focus their attention on medical concerns."
201008,63,63810,219,NA,NA,The pressure of managing a practice is a significant factor in dissuading doctors from taking up regional practice.
201008,63,63810,220,NA,NA,The Nationals will introduce a Federal plan to enable more GPs to practise more flexibly in areas chronically short of medical professionals.
201008,63,63810,221,NA,NA,"This program will offer a wider range of services to regional communities, by incorporating additional activities such as pathology and psychology, radiology and pharmaceuticals in practices managed by private providers, divisions of general practice, or if needed, by local government."
201008,63,63810,222,NA,NA,"The medical staff may become employees paid a suitable salary, and thus avoid many of the burdens that make regional medicine less attractive."
201008,63,63810,224,NA,NA,"The plethora of complex programs designed to provide incentives for doctors to take up regional practice lower their effectiveness, and skew services against regional areas in favour of outer metropolitan areas."
201008,63,63810,225,NA,NA,"Since 2000, more than 30 separate programs designed to attract doctors to regional Australia have helped boost the numbers of health providers, but have had their effectiveness hindered by red tape, duplication and conflicting goals."
201008,63,63810,226,NA,NA,"The Nationals will review and simplify these incentive programs, and ensure that Medicare systems encourage regional practice."
201008,63,63810,227,NA,NA,"The Nationals will work with the health services community to provide succession planning for our ageing specialist doctors, nurses and other health care professionals, by offering incentives to train the next generation of regional health care professionals."
201008,63,63810,229,NA,NA,"Many regions lack allied health workers - dentists, nurses, optometrists, psychiatrists and other health workers."
201008,63,63810,230,NA,NA,"The most recent statistics show that the overall number of medical practitioners employed per 100,000 people was 335 in major cities, but only 181 in inner regional areas, 153 in outer regional areas and 148 in remote or very remote areas."
201008,63,63810,231,NA,NA,"There are 59 dentists per 100,000 people in major cities, but only 35 in inner regional, 29 in outer regional, and 20 in remote or very remote areas."
201008,63,63810,232,NA,NA,"This is in spite of the fact that regional Australians suffer from higher rates of many diseases, more injuries, and higher suicide and death rates."
201008,63,63810,233,NA,NA,"Since 2000-2001, regional incentive programs have increased the number of doctors in regional and remote Australia."
201008,63,63810,234,NA,NA,"However, the importance of allied health workers, such as speech pathologists, is often overlooked."
201008,63,63810,235,NA,NA,"Many children in regional Australia miss out on appropriate treatment while young, going on to suffer permanent learning problems."
201008,63,63810,236,NA,NA,"Similarly, the lack of pathology services in regional areas places an unfair additional burden on those living with HIV, Hepatitis and other blood borne viruses."
201008,63,63810,237,NA,NA,The National Regional Health Alliance confirms that incentive schemes and scholarship programs instituted under the previous Government are delivering results.
201008,63,63810,238,NA,NA,"As part of their review of these programs, The Nationals will broaden their base to attract more dentists, nurses and other allied health workers to the regions."
201008,63,63810,240,NA,NA,Australian Health Care Agreements formalise shared funding between the State and Federal governments for acute care services in private hospitals.
201008,63,63810,241,NA,NA,"In the past, these agreements have set up goals for particular groups; and The Nationals will ensure that regional and remote Australians comprise one such group."
201008,63,63810,242,NA,NA,"The Nationals will ensure that regional health targets are built into the next round of Health Care Agreements, and that the Federal Government rewards those States that demonstrate improved delivery of health services to regional populations."
201008,63,63810,243,NA,NA,"The agreements will also require an increase in the number of regional aged care places, and additional programs for youth mental health."
201008,63,63810,245,NA,NA,The poor health and well being of indigenous Australians remains a major concern.
201008,63,63810,246,NA,NA,"Despite the vast sums of money spent by governments, indigenous Australians’ general health and life expectancy still lag substantially behind those of the broader Australian population."
201008,63,63810,247,NA,NA,"The Nationals understand that throwing more money at these problems is not the answer.  Instead, we will implement policies to:"
201008,63,63810,248,NA,NA,Provide targeted funding for health care and hygiene education;
201008,63,63810,249,NA,NA,"Introduce programs which give priority to education courses for indigenous students, and which inform them on health, hygiene, and physical and mental well being;"
201008,63,63810,250,NA,NA,Provide incentives for tertiary educated indigenous Australians to return or support the communities which most need assistance; and
201008,63,63810,251,NA,NA,"Provide resources to tackle drug and alcohol problems with programs that encourage self esteem, work participation and education."
201008,63,63810,253,NA,NA,"The Nationals will continue to provide financial support for the RFDS, in recognition of its role as the primary mantle of safety covering regional and remote communities."
201008,63,63810,255,NA,NA,Regional Australians still suffer worse health outcomes and less access to health services and professionals than Australians who live in major cities.
201008,63,63810,256,NA,NA,"Labor was elected on its promise to ‘fix’ the health system, but has merely ordered a series of window dressing reviews."
201008,63,63810,257,NA,NA,Regional Australians are paying the price for government inattention.
201008,63,63810,258,NA,NA,"The Nationals are the only party uniquely committed to regional Australia,"
201008,63,63810,259,NA,NA,and the only one which will deliver a Regional Health Rescue Plan.
201008,63,63810,263,NA,NA,Parents want to give their children the best possible education.
201008,63,63810,264,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ aim is an education system delivering high standards from pre-school to university, and providing lifelong learning opportunities for all Australians - regardless of where they live."
201008,63,63810,265,NA,NA,Education is a key responsibility of government.
201008,63,63810,266,NA,NA,State and Federal governments must work together to meet the nation’s education needs.
201008,63,63810,267,NA,NA,"We must avoid duplication of administration in education programs, and not waste funding and resources,"
201008,63,63810,268,NA,NA,to ensure we can deliver equitable education opportunities for all Australians.
201008,63,63810,269,NA,NA,"The Nationals helped to pioneer government funding for independent schools, and we continue to support parents’ right to educate their children at the school of their choice."
201008,63,63810,270,NA,NA,No child should be disadvantaged because of the choice of school or the geographical location of that school.
201008,63,63810,271,NA,NA,The Nationals will ensure an equitable split of funding between public and private schools regardless of their location.
201008,63,63810,272,NA,NA,We also recognise that Australia’s geography and demography pose some heavy challenges for regional families.
201008,63,63810,273,NA,NA,"While country schools often provide a rich and productive educational experience, particularly in the early years, access to quality education becomes increasingly difficult for secondary and tertiary students from regional Australia."
201008,63,63810,274,NA,NA,"Students from regional areas are less likely to finish year 12 than their metropolitan counterparts, and are significantly under-represented in tertiary education."
201008,63,63810,275,NA,NA,"Despite comprising over 30 per cent of Australia’s population, only 17 per cent of university students are from regional areas, and regional Australians are much less likely to hold a tertiary qualification."
201008,63,63810,276,NA,NA,"The Nationals will encourage regional students to complete Year 12, and support them when they move away from home to higher education."
201008,63,63810,277,NA,NA,The Nationals’ Regional Education Revival will use 21st Century tools to provide a 21st Century learning experience in Regional Australia.
201008,63,63810,278,NA,NA,We will partner with the States and Territories and local communities to transform the delivery of regional education.
201008,63,63810,279,NA,NA,"We will identify, train and equip outstanding teachers"
201008,63,63810,280,NA,NA,and use the internet to make them available in every regional classroom.
201008,63,63810,281,NA,NA,"We will allow school principals to lead, and delegate to them and school councils funding responsibility and accountability."
201008,63,63810,282,NA,NA,"We will encourage creativity, problem solving and teamwork while retaining a core emphasis on numeracy and literacy. We will provide students with the skill sets that employers need."
201008,63,63810,283,NA,NA,Only The Nationals will provide the vision and leadership to bring quality education to Regional Australia.
201008,63,63810,285,NA,NA,The Labor Government’s approach to education yet again demonstrates the triumph of rhetoric over reality and has delivered little in real educational outcomes.
201008,63,63810,286,NA,NA,"For example, Labor’s undertaking to provide a computer for every student aged 9 to 12 shrank into providing a computer for every second student."
201008,63,63810,287,NA,NA,The program cost doubled:  we got half the outcome for twice the price.
201008,63,63810,288,NA,NA,The undertaking to provide a trade training centre in every school translated into a single trade training centre covering as many as 10 schools.
201008,63,63810,289,NA,NA,The infamous ‘Education Revolution’ building program is becoming a case study for how not to design or administer a government program.
201008,63,63810,290,NA,NA,The State-imposed system of project ‘templates’ means many schools are ending up with infrastructure they neither want or that doesn’t meet their needs.
201008,63,63810,291,NA,NA,"The tendering system, which includes ‘short lists’ of eligible companies, guarantees inflated prices."
201008,63,63810,292,NA,NA,Many millions of dollars have been wasted on this program.
201008,63,63810,293,NA,NA,"Although one of the aims is employment generation, there is no measure of the number of jobs any project supports."

201008,63,63810,295,NA,NA,"In government, The Nationals will place any money left in this program in the hands of school boards and principals who are best placed to know how and where the priorities for their schools lie."
201008,63,63810,296,NA,NA,Perhaps Labor’s cruellest blow to regional education outcomes lay in the 2009 Budget changes to the Youth Allowance.
201008,63,63810,297,NA,NA,Thousands of regional families were unlikely to be able to afford to send their children to university.
201008,63,63810,298,NA,NA,The Nationals were instrumental in negotiating changes to the Government’s policy and as a result more young people in regional Australia are now eligible.
201008,63,63810,299,NA,NA,"Nevertheless, narrower eligibility criteria constitute unreasonable and unrealistic hurdles for regional families, and many will not be able to meet the full cost of remote education out of their own resources."
201008,63,63810,300,NA,NA,A new system of support for regional tertiary students will be a priority for The Nationals in government.

201008,63,63810,311,NA,NA,Special measures are required to enable people living in regional and remote areas to share that access.
201008,63,63810,312,NA,NA,"The Nationals will reform the Youth Allowance and, in particular, will wind back the 2009 Budget changes which disadvantage regional families."
201008,63,63810,313,NA,NA,"In its 2009 Budget, Labor’s changes to the eligibility criteria mean that Independent Youth Allowance is not available to students under 22 unless they have worked full time for two years."
201008,63,63810,314,NA,NA,The Nationals believe this work test is patently unrealistic – given the limited availability of jobs in small regional centres.
201008,63,63810,315,NA,NA,"We believe furthermore that income tests are unreasonable, given the additional costs faced by regional families with children at university."
201008,63,63810,316,NA,NA,"To address the real costs of living away from home for education, The Nationals propose a new, targeted, rural and regional scholarship program to assist regional students who cannot stay at home with their parents to pursue further study."
201008,63,63810,317,NA,NA,A key part of this will be a new tertiary access allowance.
201008,63,63810,318,NA,NA,"All students for whom public transport is not reasonably available within 90 minutes of their place of study, will be eligible for the tertiary access allowance."
201008,63,63810,319,NA,NA,"The new allowance will replace the current relocation allowance and the independent youth allowance, which will only be available for hardship cases."
201008,63,63810,320,NA,NA,"To help maintain contact between families and their children studying far from home, The Nationals support the establishment of a nation-wide family reunion travel pass, providing free public transport for students returning home for family visits."
201008,63,63810,321,NA,NA,"We will also work with the Isolated Children’s’ Parents Association to introduce early childhood programs to ensure all children have access to affordable, high quality early childhood education."
201008,63,63810,322,NA,NA,"The Nationals will continue to support the Assistance for Isolated Children’s’ Allowance, and ensure that it is reviewed on a regular basis so that it can be adapted to changing needs."
201008,63,63810,323,NA,NA,The Nationals further support direct funding through the Priority Country Areas Program to eliminate the burden and delay of State Government bureaucracy.
201008,63,63810,325,NA,NA,"As Nationals, we believe our young people hold the key to the future prosperity of regional Australia.   Government support for public and private education is an investment in the future of our nation."

201008,63,63810,328,NA,NA,"This was demonstrated under the previous Coalition Government’s Investing in Our Schools program, which delivered more than 20,000 small infrastructure projects in schools."
201008,63,63810,329,NA,NA,The Nationals will ensure that local school communities have a direct say in the expenditure of any further funds provided by the Commonwealth for infrastructure improvements.
201008,63,63810,330,NA,NA,"The Nationals support an Australia wide curriculum that has emphasis on the three R’s and also includes citizenship education, lifestyle training and health."
201008,63,63810,331,NA,NA,"We support the concept of performance measures, with those schools that are found to be falling behind securing financial and/or skills support to bring them up to the national standard."
201008,63,63810,332,NA,NA,"To help provide our young people with other necessary life skills, The Nationals will introduce a national youth safety program, to give students basic first aid competencies by Year 10, and to provide all students with a basic introduction to pre-driver education and training."
201008,63,63810,333,NA,NA,"We will also provide opportunities for young people to receive drug, obesity and general health education."
201008,63,63810,334,NA,NA,"Attracting and retaining skilled educators in regional Australia is a perennial problem, one exacerbated by the States offering different pay rates to entice teachers to relocate States."
201008,63,63810,335,NA,NA,"The Nationals support the development of a standardised national system of incentive payments which will encourage qualified teachers to relocate to, or remain in, rural and regional locations."
201008,63,63810,336,NA,NA,"In addition, The Nationals support bonded scholarships for regional students to study in areas of skills shortage at university – with the proviso that, at the completion of their studies, they agree to return to an area of need for a fixed period of three years."
201008,63,63810,337,NA,NA,Regional universities – and the regional campuses of city universities – play a valuable part in improving access to education for students in the regions.
201008,63,63810,338,NA,NA,The Nationals support policies which encourage and support the universities to deliver services in regional communities.
201008,63,63810,339,NA,NA,"We believe that university councils should have the power to include, in setting their fees, an amount to cover a limited range of student services, particularly the sporting and recreational facilities which so enhance the university experience."
201008,63,63810,340,NA,NA,The educational experience of attending university is more than sitting in lectures.  Naturally
201008,63,63810,341,NA,NA,", use of such fees for any political purposes or to fund student union activities would be specifically ruled out."
201008,63,63810,342,NA,NA,"The Nationals will provide financial resources through a Faculty of Excellence Program for regional universities, to allow them to focus on particular areas of excellence which will enhance the university’s reputation."
201008,63,63810,343,NA,NA,The Nationals also believe that a quality education is not dependent on attending university.
201008,63,63810,344,NA,NA,"Many regional students would prefer vocational training and apprenticeships, and regional Australia needs skilled tradespeople."
201008,63,63810,345,NA,NA,The waste of up to $5 billion on rorts in the school hall program could have paid for hundreds of thousands of apprenticeships.
201008,63,63810,346,NA,NA,The Nationals will ensure that vocational training receives the attention it deserves to ensure that regional Australia gets the skilled workers it needs.
201008,63,63810,347,NA,NA,Regional students must have real choices about their education and hence their future.
201008,63,63810,349,NA,NA,"The Nationals recognise how difficult it can be for families with children with special needs to access education in regional areas, and will provide adequate resources for schools to provide support for these children."
201008,63,63810,350,NA,NA,"As a matter of principle, we support a funding model that ‘ties’ assistance for these students to the student; that is, when students relocate, the funding transfers with them."
201008,63,63810,351,NA,NA,"The Nationals also support a funding model which treats students with special needs in non-government schools equally, and on the same basis, as children attending government schools."
201008,63,63810,352,NA,NA,"We support measures to harmonise the treatment of these students across State borders, to ensure their families are well supported in seeking the best possible educational outcomes for their children."
201008,63,63810,354,NA,NA,"Bonded scholarships have been introduced for medical students to attract new doctors to regional areas, and these schemes have produced positive results."
201008,63,63810,355,NA,NA,The Nationals support the introduction of a scheme to refund the HECS fees of graduates who work in regional areas of need and contribute to the economic development and social fabric of regional Australia.
201008,63,63810,357,NA,NA,"The current education system does not provide the same opportunities for students from regional areas, particularly at a tertiary level."
201008,63,63810,358,NA,NA,"The Nationals advocate policy solutions to assist students from regional areas to achieve their full potential, so they can return to regional Australia and deploy their acquired skills and knowledge."
201008,63,63810,359,NA,NA,"The Nationals will work closely with local school communities, not lock them out – to ensure that regional communities remain active participants in the educational outcomes of their young people."
201008,63,63810,360,NA,NA,"We believe that education is a lifelong experience, and that the best results are achieved by governments working in respectful partnership with local communities and providing high quality facilities and services."

201008,63,63810,367,NA,NA,"Only The Nationals understand the important role communications play in regional Australia. The Nationals will meet the challenge of bridging the communications divide between regions and capital cities, through well considered planning and prioritising of communications infrastructure."

201008,63,63810,384,NA,NA,"Labor cancelled the Coalition’s $900 million Opel contract, which by now would have been delivering high speed broadband to regional Australia."
201008,63,63810,385,NA,NA,Labor is planning to spend $40 billion on a national broadband network (NBN) without first developing a business plan or addressing the central concern of regulatory access to the communications infrastructure already held in private ownership.
201008,63,63810,386,NA,NA,It has been more than two years since Labor announced its NBN program but very few new customers have actually been connected.
201008,63,63810,387,NA,NA,"Labor still appears uncertain whether to create a new solely owned and nationalised network, or whether to use existing networks built by private companies as part of its own network."
201008,63,63810,388,NA,NA,"Early in 2009, Labor announced that no communications company could provide a suitable tender for the NBN project."
201008,63,63810,389,NA,NA,"Months later, it was suggested that Telstra and Optus might offer their existing networks to be incorporated into the national broadband network."
201008,63,63810,390,NA,NA,"No matter which option Labor chooses, the plan is ill-conceived."
201008,63,63810,391,NA,NA,Previous commercial attempts to build completely new networks have failed.
201008,63,63810,392,NA,NA,"If Labor pursues its tactic of merging existing networks into its own, the same regulatory problems which hinder competition in the industry will continue."
201008,63,63810,393,NA,NA,"In short, Labor’s plan does not address the central concern of regulation and of open access to communications infrastructure, and it will see regional Australians treated as second-class citizens."
201008,63,63810,394,NA,NA,"Labor also abolished the $2 billion Communications Fund established by The Nationals to ensure that regional Australians had continued access to new communications technology, and has plundered its contents."

201008,63,63810,403,NA,NA,We will work to create a regulatory environment favouring initiative and support for those providing services to the regions.
201008,63,63810,404,NA,NA,The Nationals recognise that no single technology or network can provide efficient and cost-effective communications services – broadband in particular – to all non-metropolitan Australia.
201008,63,63810,405,NA,NA,"We will assist in the development of communications infrastructure suitable for a vast range of needs and applications, taking into account the geographical diversity of Australian regions."
201008,63,63810,406,NA,NA,The Nationals will ensure that regional Australians are integrated into the global community by fast-tracking communications infrastructure in areas with the greatest need.
201008,63,63810,407,NA,NA,"We recognise that, while the market will almost always meet the communications needs of people in the capital cities, government intervention is necessary to ensure those needs are met in the regional and remote parts of Australia."
201008,63,63810,408,NA,NA,The roll-out of a broadband network in regional Australia is a major priority for The Nationals.
201008,63,63810,409,NA,NA,Regional Australia must be integrated into the national and global digital economies by fast and effective broadband communications.
201008,63,63810,410,NA,NA,Lack of access to infrastructure is a major barrier to new telecommunications companies that wish to compete in regional areas.
201008,63,63810,411,NA,NA,"Carriers find that the cost of establishing new infrastructure in these areas is often prohibitive, particularly when they are unsure of market demand."
201008,63,63810,412,NA,NA,Lower population densities cannot deliver the economies of scale required to generate investment.
201008,63,63810,413,NA,NA,"Where the market cannot sustain a variety of networks in regional areas, The Nationals believe that government has a responsibility to provide an affordable single network."
201008,63,63810,414,NA,NA,Public/ private partnerships can be an appropriate vehicle for delivering telecommunications infrastructure.
201008,63,63810,415,NA,NA,Labor has misunderstood both the market and the problem.
201008,63,63810,416,NA,NA,"Broadband speeds of 100Mbps are already available to commercial and home users in some capital cities where, as demand grows for higher speeds, the market will continue to meet it."
201008,63,63810,417,NA,NA,The Federal Government does not need to help these providers.
201008,63,63810,418,NA,NA,"However, it does need to help in regional areas, where the commercial case is not strong enough to drive the provision of higher speed service."
201008,63,63810,419,NA,NA,"In regional Australia, the greatest productivity gains will be made from high speed broadband."
201008,63,63810,420,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ policy is to place a priority on rolling out fibre optic cable to the majority of consumers in regional Australia, before cable roll-out occurs in areas where competition is already driving the provision of higher broadband speeds."
201008,63,63810,421,NA,NA,Fibre optic cable is regarded as the preferred data carrying technology for the foreseeable future.
201008,63,63810,422,NA,NA,"However, other technologies such as wireless (fixed and mobile) and satellite continue to develop, delivering ever-faster data speeds."
201008,63,63810,423,NA,NA,It may be that these technologies will throw up innovative and effective answers to some of the communications problems presented by Australia’s unique population spread.
201008,63,63810,424,NA,NA,"Developments in existing technologies will be marketed first in the cities where the commercial return is most attractive, widening the telecommunications technology gap between city and regional Australia."
201008,63,63810,425,NA,NA,The Nationals support the continuing extension of the optic fibre network to regional and remote communities currently relying on wireless and microwave technology.
201008,63,63810,426,NA,NA,"We support the continued presence of Telstra in regional communities, including the physical presence of Telstra Country Wide offices in strategic locations."
201008,63,63810,427,NA,NA,"Mobile phone coverage is a continuing concern for The Nationals, and, again, the service will not be provided in some parts of Australia unless supported by the government and community."
201008,63,63810,428,NA,NA,The previous Coalition Government established a standing telecommunications fund to ensure new technology and services were available to regional Australia as they became available; the term was ‘future proofing’.
201008,63,63810,429,NA,NA,"As a central plank of our telecommunications platform, The Nationals commit to re-introducing a standing telecommunications fund of a size to ensure that regional Australia’s telecommunications services do not fall behind."
201008,63,63810,430,NA,NA,We will also reintroduce a mobile phone ‘black spot’ program to identify and redress areas of poor mobile phone reception and to ensure that mobile networks are kept affordable.
201008,63,63810,431,NA,NA,Conclusion
201008,63,63810,432,NA,NA,"The provision of world-class communications infrastructure and services should be a priority for government, and requires continued policy development and management."
201008,63,63810,433,NA,NA,Spending billions of dollars and laying cable all over the country will not ‘fix’ the problem.
201008,63,63810,434,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ approach seeks to strike a good competitive balance between carriers,"
201008,63,63810,435,NA,NA,"establish a fair and transparent regulatory structure,"
201008,63,63810,436,NA,NA,"and accommodate new technologies and solutions as they become available, to deliver effective services suitable for all Australians."
201008,63,63810,440,NA,NA,Families are the basis for Australia’s future prosperity.
201008,63,63810,441,NA,NA,Families in regional Australia face challenges brought about by remoteness and difficulty in accessing services readily available to those in the major cities.
201008,63,63810,442,NA,NA,"But while The Nationals aim to provide support for the seven million Australians living outside the major centres, the principles of our policy apply to all Australian families."
201008,63,63810,443,NA,NA,The Nationals recognise the importance of a balance between work and family and that demographics and geography in Australia mean that regional families are more reliant on the support of government and community organisations.
201008,63,63810,444,NA,NA,"The Nationals believe that a family unit comprising two parents, with one as a full time carer at least until the children reach school age, children and grandparents, provides the best chance for a prosperous, stable and happy family relationship."
201008,63,63810,445,NA,NA,"However, we recognise that this is not always possible."
201008,63,63810,446,NA,NA,"Families where both parents work are becoming more common, and many children live in an environment where their parents are apart."
201008,63,63810,447,NA,NA,"Compared to those in major cities, children in regional Australia are less likely to be in formal child care, and more likely to be at home with parents or cared under other informal arrangements."
201008,63,63810,448,NA,NA,"As Nationals, we understand the importance of a strong economy as the basis for social good."
201008,63,63810,449,NA,NA,Restoring the economy and reducing Government debt will be our priority on return to government.
201008,63,63810,450,NA,NA,By doing this we will be able to fully provide the necessary level of support for families living in regional areas.
201008,63,63810,452,NA,NA,The family support services put in place by Labor are narrow and discriminate against those families outside the major metropolitan centres.
201008,63,63810,453,NA,NA,Labor has a history of centrally controlled bureaucratic and difficult-to access family services.
201008,63,63810,454,NA,NA,"Rather than encouraging family independence and unity, they tend to result in fragmentation of the family unit."
201008,63,63810,455,NA,NA,"In 2004, the then Leader of the Labor party conceded that families would be worse off under Labor’s Tax and Family policy."
201008,63,63810,456,NA,NA,Nothing has changed.
201008,63,63810,457,NA,NA,"Labor’s economic recklessness and panicked overcompensation for the global financial crisis, the resultant huge national debt, and the wasteful and mismanaged education and home insulation programs have left Australian families with a debt they will be paying off for decades to come."

201008,63,63810,485,NA,NA,The Nationals believe that it is important for families to have the option of staying together wherever possible.
201008,63,63810,486,NA,NA,"This can be particularly difficult in regional areas, where older parents and senior grandparents are involved, and where appropriate aged care facilities are often far from the family unit."
201008,63,63810,487,NA,NA,"We will provide funding, and work with all levels of government and community groups to increase the number of aged care facilities and places in regional areas."
201008,63,63810,488,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ objective is to assist older Australians to age productively, and to age with dignity Ageing productively is about fulfilling potential, recognising that the great majority of older Australians can and do contribute to society right through their latter years."
201008,63,63810,489,NA,NA,"It is about remaining active and engaged, about taking responsibility for one’s health, about working or providing service to the community in the many ways available."
201008,63,63810,490,NA,NA,Ageing productively helps to keep people healthy and will mitigate any perception that seniors may become a “burden” as society feels the pressure of an ageing population.
201008,63,63810,491,NA,NA,"Ageing with dignity is about ensuring that older Australians have access to pensions, superannuation retirement savings, and health and aged care which allow them to age in a manner of which Australia as a nation would be proud."
201008,63,63810,492,NA,NA,It also means having safety nets in place to provide that dignity for those who may not have the financial resources for living expenses or health and aged care.

201008,63,63810,508,NA,NA,There is a universal lack of confidence in the health system.
201008,63,63810,509,NA,NA,This impacts especially on older Australians who have a greater need for health services. The Nationals will:
201008,63,63810,510,NA,NA,Reduce the levels of government bureaucracy
201008,63,63810,511,NA,NA,and make a greater commitment to supporting the health system with more nurses and doctors.

201008,63,63810,523,NA,NA,They deliver for families and for the whole community.   The Nationals will:
201008,63,63810,524,NA,NA,Commit to strongly recognising the role of carers whatever their age and the age of the person receiving care.
201008,63,63810,525,NA,NA,"For carers who leave the workplace to deliver care,"
201008,63,63810,526,NA,NA,The Nationals will consider the provision of superannuation payments over and above existing carer allowances.

201008,63,63810,528,NA,NA,"The Nationals recognise that grandparents are increasingly required to assume a greater role in supporting grandchildren, which places an emotional and financial strain on them."
201008,63,63810,529,NA,NA,The role of grandparents in this situation will to be better supported by The Nationals. We will:
201008,63,63810,530,NA,NA,Develop grandparent liaison officers in Centrelink to assist grandparents in navigating the system.
201008,63,63810,531,NA,NA,Provide emergency or discretionary payments to grandparents where children are placed in care at short notice.

The Nationals will:"

201008,63,63810,537,NA,NA,"Whilst ageism is a community problem, The Nationals will provide leadership to help shift community attitudes. We will:"
201008,63,63810,538,NA,NA,Ensure that age discrimination legislation and regulatory mechanisms are established and resourced in the same manner as other antidiscrimination measures.
201008,63,63810,539,NA,NA,Review all Commonwealth legislation and act to remove any remaining provisions  which treat people unfairly because of their age.
201008,63,63810,541,NA,NA,The Nationals have a proud record of supporting a social framework for all regional Australians and in recognising the social and economic benefits of maintaining a strong family unit.
201008,63,63810,542,NA,NA,"We will provide resources and give priority to working with State, Territory and local governments and community groups to ensure that families in regional Australia have the support they need, and the best possible services available."

201008,63,63810,548,NA,NA,"To achieve an outcome that ensures the prosperity and quality of life for future generations, The Nationals believe that workable partnerships must be in place between all levels of government, researchers and natural resource managers."
201008,63,63810,549,NA,NA,"We believe that there is much to learn from those who work our land, water and ocean resources.  Today’s food and fibre producers know that the environment in which they operate is different from that faced by their grandparents, and will be different again for their grandchildren."
201008,63,63810,550,NA,NA,They also know that knowledge is never complete; there is always a need for continuous improvement and learning.
201008,63,63810,551,NA,NA,The Nationals recognise that climate change is an immediate environmental priority and that a robust and realistic policy response is necessary.
201008,63,63810,552,NA,NA,"However, climate change can only be successfully addressed in the overall context of environmental, economic and social good."
201008,63,63810,554,NA,NA,"Labor’s approach to the environment is dominated by its emissions trading scheme (ETS), the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), at the expense of any broader environmental program to involve the general community in the management of Australia’s eco systems.  The community based programs put in place by The Nationals while in government have had their funding all but removed."
201008,63,63810,555,NA,NA,Labor has shown that it neither appreciates nor cares about the socio-economic impact on regional Australians of its flawed policies.
201008,63,63810,556,NA,NA,"Labor’s CPRS is riddled with anomalies, exemptions and carve-outs."
201008,63,63810,557,NA,NA,"It would cripple Australian industry’s international competitiveness by taxing exports, and giving imports a free ride."
201008,63,63810,558,NA,NA,"It would not provide the appropriate price signals to change consumer behaviour, and would do little to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions - except by moving our exporting industries offshore, with no net global benefit."
201008,63,63810,559,NA,NA,"Research prepared by the State and Territory governments shows that 126,000 full-time jobs would be lost by Labor’s plan, with the regional centres hit the hardest."
201008,63,63810,560,NA,NA,"The economies of Gippsland, Geelong, central-west Queensland, central Western Australia, the Kimberley and Whyalla/Port Pirie would each shrink by more than 20 per cent under Labor’s CPRS."
201008,63,63810,561,NA,NA,"Beef and sheep producers, dairy, sugar and grains would all be hit by higher electricity, fuel and freight costs and lower farm grant prices."
201008,63,63810,562,NA,NA,"Coal miners, aluminium and zinc producers and natural gas projects would fail, and new investment would move offshore."
201008,63,63810,563,NA,NA,"A massive new administration would have to be established, to churn the $13 billion raised from year one to the chosen few who Labor decide deserve compensation."
201008,63,63810,564,NA,NA,"In short, Labor’s CPRS is little more than a massive social re-engineering project."
201008,63,63810,565,NA,NA,"It would wreak havoc on the Australian economy while barely reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, as measured by consumption – and it would make little or no net contribution to reducing emissions globally."
201008,63,63810,566,NA,NA,"The impact on consumers would be substantial, bringing higher electricity, fuel and food prices."
201008,63,63810,567,NA,NA,"For all these reasons, The Nationals rejected Labor’s CPRS from day one and we will continue to oppose it."

201008,63,63810,576,NA,NA,The Nationals support an effective global program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to insure against the risk of climate change.
201008,63,63810,577,NA,NA,Wealthy industrialised countries like Australia must take a lead role in implementing a global response if we expect developing countries to contribute to the solution.
201008,63,63810,578,NA,NA,"The Nationals therefore support an Australian objective of a 5 per cent reduction in emissions below 2000 levels by 2020, with larger reductions dependent on a strong international agreement being reached."
201008,63,63810,579,NA,NA,This would mean that Australia would reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases from 552.7 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2000 to 525 million tonnes in 2020.
201008,63,63810,580,NA,NA,"The Nationals will ensure that this target is achieved without economic harm or loss of jobs, and by measures which themselves directly benefit Australia."
201008,63,63810,581,NA,NA,"The Nationals are concerned with our communities, not with mindless symbolism."
201008,63,63810,582,NA,NA,A “solution” which weakens the Australian economy and creates unemployment helps no-one.
201008,63,63810,583,NA,NA,We believe that Australia must play its part in addressing climate change issues.
201008,63,63810,584,NA,NA,"However, the necessary environmental outcomes can be achieved without the purchase and sale of carbon credits, and without a CPRS."
201008,63,63810,585,NA,NA,We believe practical measures should be taken now:
201008,63,63810,586,NA,NA,"The CPRS should be jettisoned, not just set aside."
201008,63,63810,587,NA,NA,"Australia should continue to develop and use practical CO2 emissions reduction measures, such as soil carbon sequestration, the revegetation of marginal land, bio-char, clean coal technology, carbon capture and the use of algae."
201008,63,63810,588,NA,NA,"Australia should open a voluntary carbon market to encourage the immediate recognition and involvement of individuals and communities, agriculture and business in sequestration, with bankable offsets."
201008,63,63810,589,NA,NA,"Energy savings initiatives in households, industry and transport to reduce emissions should be supported."
201008,63,63810,590,NA,NA,Incentives should be provided for more energy efficient vehicles and more widespread use of alternative fuels.
201008,63,63810,591,NA,NA,Governments should engage the commercial building sector in improving the energy efficiency of city buildings and residential housing.
201008,63,63810,592,NA,NA,"Incentives should be provided for the innovative use of renewable energy, without forcing large increases in energy prices."
201008,63,63810,593,NA,NA,"These measures have the potential to deliver greater reductions in emissions than Labor’s CPRS, without the massive economic cost and job losses."
201008,63,63810,594,NA,NA,"For example, Professor Ross Garnaut estimated that land restoration works on degraded arid and semi-arid rangelands could by themselves reduce Australian annual emissions by 250 million tonnes of CO2– easily meeting the target of 5 per cent reduction in emissions at 2000 levels by 2020."
201008,63,63810,595,NA,NA,This would also provide a significant increase in farm income for many land managers.
201008,63,63810,597,NA,NA,"The Nationals recognise the importance of our natural resources, and understand that local communities and individual property owners are often best placed to protect the natural environment."
201008,63,63810,598,NA,NA,We will directly support catchment management and Landcare organisations.
201008,63,63810,599,NA,NA,The Nationals will reinstate the funding lost by land and water management groups such as Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) because of poor policy decisions by government.
201008,63,63810,600,NA,NA,"The current system is clearly flawed, with the Government demanding that CMAs apply national priorities to local projects, even where there is clearly no correlation."
201008,63,63810,601,NA,NA,"The Nationals will work with local CMAs to determine the best outcomes, and encourage local groups to determine their own projects, within catchment plans."
201008,63,63810,602,NA,NA,We will implement long term funding based on local plans within national objectives.
201008,63,63810,603,NA,NA,The Nationals understand the importance of Landcare groups to local communities.
201008,63,63810,604,NA,NA,"We value the 4000 Landcare groups in Australia, and recognise that almost 40 per cent of farmers were previously involved in Landcare organisations."
201008,63,63810,605,NA,NA,The Nationals will reinstate support for the Landcare groups Labor has disendorsed and will restore funding cut by the Labor Government.
201008,63,63810,606,NA,NA,We will restore funding to the 56 natural resource management regions to 2007 levels.
201008,63,63810,607,NA,NA,The Nationals will invest in a re-plumbing of regional Australia and will work with farmers and local communities to invest in long term water infrastructure.
201008,63,63810,608,NA,NA,"We will review legislation to ensure that environmental, socio-economic and resource management considerations are all taken into account."
201008,63,63810,610,NA,NA,Ever-increasing use of our oceans for commercial and recreation activities means that greater care must be taken to ensure these delicate eco systems are protected.
201008,63,63810,611,1,0,"So that Australia can respond to threats to the marine environment from pollution from ships, increased tourism, agricultural chemicals, and illegal fishing, The Nationals will ensure that regulatory, research and voluntary organisations are adequately funded and coordinated."
201008,63,63810,612,NA,NA,This includes strengthening the role of the Marine Environment Protection Association established by the Coalition Government in November 1999.
201008,63,63810,613,NA,NA,"The Nationals will introduce legislation to make it mandatory for all ships in Australian waters to carry a satellite transponder, so that their position is continually monitored."
201008,63,63810,615,NA,NA,Successful environmental policy involves integrating responsible environmental management in all policy decisions.
201008,63,63810,616,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ approach to protection of the environment takes account of human and natural activities on our eco systems, quality of life and resource management."
201008,63,63810,617,NA,NA,"We will not distort international trade or divert new investment to greenhouse emissions havens, but will encourage an orderly transition of the power generating industry to low emissions or carbon storage technology.  We support studies into the use of alternative-based power generation systems including nuclear energy."
201008,63,63810,618,NA,NA,"We will support practical land and water management, and encourage technologies such as bio-fuels which assist to help maintain clean air. We will provide protection for our unique flora and fauna and our oceans, while maintaining access for productive use."
201008,63,63810,619,NA,NA,We will not support Labor’s CPRS which would have such a detrimental impact on the lives of regional Australians and would achieve no effective environmental outcomes.
201008,63,63810,623,NA,NA,"Careful management and sound decisions on water allocations and usage are essential to our long term economic, social and environmental survival."
201008,63,63810,624,NA,NA,The Nationals are committed to effective management of Australia’s water resources.
201008,63,63810,625,NA,NA,We led the way in introducing water resources reform and have set the agenda for water trading by introducing legislation aimed at better water sharing agreements.
201008,63,63810,626,NA,NA,The Nationals’ credentials in water resource management are founded on sound planning and a respect for the rights of all Australians.
201008,63,63810,628,NA,NA,Labor has taken a “just add water and mix” approach to environmental management.
201008,63,63810,629,NA,NA,"Instead of looking at a range of possible solutions, Labor has hijacked water resources to address environmental concerns and has spent billions on piecemeal water buy backs without any clear strategic plan – like buying water in the Murray Darling Basin at the cheapest price, regardless of the social or economic impact on regional communities."
201008,63,63810,630,NA,NA,The Labor Government has scrapped the Community Water Grants program.
201008,63,63810,631,NA,NA,"Land and water management programs have been grouped under one banner, ‘Caring for Our Country’, and overall funding has been cut. Landcare has lost 20 per cent of its funding, catchment management bodies have lost 40 per cent of theirs and the EnviroFund has been abolished altogether."
201008,63,63810,632,NA,NA,"Accessing the available funding has been made more difficult by the competitive, on-line only, application process, where small local groups find themselves pitted against large corporations and government agencies."
201008,63,63810,633,NA,NA,"Labor’s policies have drastically reduced access to funding for land owners who have successfully maintained a sustainable balance of land use, and denied them the ability to put their experience into practice."

201008,63,63810,643,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ policy is to buy water only as a last resort, when no other option is available, and where investment in water infrastructure and on farm practices cannot produce the efficiencies needed."
201008,63,63810,644,NA,NA,"Buy backs lead to waterless properties, the loss of jobs and loss of production from farmers, and a loss of viability of regional communities."
201008,63,63810,646,NA,NA,The Nationals will work with local communities on practical projects which save water in our cities and towns.
201008,63,63810,647,NA,NA,There are currently no specific national funding opportunities for schools and community groups for this purpose.
201008,63,63810,648,NA,NA,"We recognise the importance of allowing local groups to play their part in water saving and sharing programs, and will reintroduce a water grants program similar to our previous successful program, Community Water Grants."

201008,63,63810,653,NA,NA,Campaigns to encourage better water practices around the home are valuable in changing daily habits and views about water as a resource.

201008,63,63810,809,NA,NA,We will introduce a range of measures to expand the domestic bio fuels industry and to promote greater consumer uptake.
201008,63,63810,811,NA,NA,A national ethanol mandate for petrol and bio-diesel will be introduced by 2015.
201008,63,63810,812,NA,NA,"Many of the States have introduced ethanol mandates, or are in the process of doing so."
201008,63,63810,813,NA,NA,"To ensure uniformity, the Federal Government needs to introduce a national mandate which ensures each State has an ethanol blend.   The introduction of such a measure would form part of an overall general strategy to meet renewable fuel targets and reduce CO2 emissions."
201008,63,63810,814,NA,NA,"In consultation with industry, The Nationals have found most local producers believe they can meet a substantial amount of Australia’s demand."

201008,63,63810,817,NA,NA,"To assist the environment and the further development of a locally based ethanol and bio diesel industry, The Nationals will support a deferral of the introduction of excise on alternative fuels, currently proposed to be phased in over the period 2011-2015."
201008,63,63810,818,NA,NA,We will also ensure that imports of bio-fuels which are subsidised by foreign government will not receive the benefits of the excise rebate in Australia.
201008,63,63810,819,NA,NA,The Nationals will address any excise loop holes and ensure that our producers are operating on an even playing field.
201008,63,63810,821,NA,NA,"The Nationals will also work to ensure that both domestic and imported bio-fuels meet a sustainability standard which includes the provision that, in the long term, fuels must not be produced at the expense of food security."
201008,63,63810,822,NA,NA,"Sustainability standards for biofuels are being developed in a number of European countries and Brazil, and can encourage biofuel producers to move from food stocks to non-food stock materials for fuel production."
201008,63,63810,823,NA,NA,Australia predominantly produces biofuels from waste or low grade products.
201008,63,63810,824,NA,NA,A sustainability standard not only protects Australia’s interests but ensures global grain trading is balanced and prevents abuses of environmental or human rights in the production of bio-fuels.
201008,63,63810,826,NA,NA,The Nationals acknowledge that retail providers face the costs of updating fuel tanks to accommodate biofuels.
201008,63,63810,827,NA,NA,We are particularly concerned that the small independent rural and remote retailers will find the transition costs prohibitive.
201008,63,63810,828,NA,NA,We understand that petroleum storage tanks at retail outlets manufactured after 1981 are compatible with a 10 per cent ethanol blend but some will require new lining to prevent leakage.
201008,63,63810,829,NA,NA,The Nationals will work with the States to develop funding schemes which complement the existing assistance offered by some State governments.
201008,63,63810,831,NA,NA,Car manufacturers are often ahead of fuel suppliers in manufacturing vehicles able to use a range of ethanol blended fuels.

201008,63,63810,856,NA,NA,The establishment of a thriving bio-fuels industry has many benefits for regional Australia.
201008,63,63810,857,NA,NA,"Most notable are the better environmental outcomes,"
201008,63,63810,858,NA,NA,a more diverse income source for farmers
201008,63,63810,859,NA,NA,and the jobs created by the construction and operation of refinery plants.
201008,63,63810,860,NA,NA,"The Nationals support cleaner fuels because they are good for the environment, and a substantial step toward developing national fuel security and self sufficiency."
201008,63,63810,864,NA,NA,"Australian farmers, fishers and foresters are among the best in the world at producing clean, green, safe food and fibre, and excel at doing it in environmentally sustainable ways."
201008,63,63810,865,NA,NA,"Australia is one of the world’s most important food and fibre producing nations, and we can increase our productivity significantly – as long we have the right policy framework."
201008,63,63810,866,NA,NA,The Nationals believe Australians should be more than just self-sufficient in food – we have a responsibility to help feed the rest of the world and its rapidly expanding population.
201008,63,63810,867,NA,NA,Population pressure is placing increasing demands on global food and fibre and production.
201008,63,63810,868,NA,NA,"Many of the world’s traditional food and fibre producing areas face issues such as urban spread, desertification and declining water resources, resulting in fewer areas available for food and fibre production."
201008,63,63810,869,NA,NA,"Food and water security are already becoming the defining issues of the 21st century, and food producers are coming under enormous pressure to increase productivity while using fewer natural resources."
201008,63,63810,870,NA,NA,We need to think more strategically about our food supply. It is in our best interests to recognise that our food security is intrinsically linked to our national security and economic health.
201008,63,63810,871,NA,NA,Feeding our nation and fulfilling our trade obligations are fundamental government priorities.
201008,63,63810,872,NA,NA,The Nationals will provide the nation with a new policy direction for primary production.
201008,63,63810,874,NA,NA,"Successive Labor Budgets have targeted the agriculture, fisheries and forestry portfolio as a source of cost savings, raiding the budgets for the food and fibre sectors which contribute so much to Australia’s future prosperity."
201008,63,63810,875,NA,NA,"Labor imposed additional costs on producers, reduced research funding, and slashed government spending on quarantine and bio-security."
201008,63,63810,876,NA,NA,This irresponsible approach to food and fibre policy is clearly seen in the handling of quarantine and bio security.
201008,63,63810,877,NA,NA,The Agriculture Minister commissioned a $1.7 million review of quarantine and inspection services (The Beale Review) and duly accepted ‘in principle’ all 84 of the report’s recommendations.
201008,63,63810,878,NA,NA,One of Beale’s conclusions recommended a $260 million annual increase in quarantine and bio-security spending; subsequent Budgets delivered funding cuts instead.
201008,63,63810,879,NA,NA,"Then, for good measure, Labor proposed increases of up to tenfold for the user charges imposed on exporters."
201008,63,63810,880,NA,NA,"Despite the urgent need to make more efficient use of water in agriculture, the Labor Government decided to abolish Land and Water Australia, which since 1990 has been one of the country’s most successful public-private research partnerships, and a body which achieved a long-term rate of return of $4.80 in economic benefits for every $1 of government funding"
201008,63,63810,881,NA,NA,"At the time the nation ought to be nurturing food and fibre production, the Government’s policies have been undermining confidence and inhibiting sustainable growth in the farming sector."
201008,63,63810,882,NA,NA,"Meanwhile the responsible Minister has been made part time, being given other non-portfolio responsibilities."

201008,63,63810,893,NA,NA,"People in regional Australia speak of the increasing ‘disconnect’ between the realities, challenges and rewards of primary production, and the perception among urban dwellers of regional life."
201008,63,63810,894,NA,NA,"The lack of understanding in the cities, where policies are developed, results in unrealistic policies, particularly on environmental matters, which are then imposed on primary producers."
201008,63,63810,895,NA,NA,The Nationals believe the vital role primary producers play in the economic and social fabric of the nation should be formally recognised in a major government policy statement.
201008,63,63810,896,NA,NA,"We will audit all environmental legislation at local, State and Federal level, with the intent to streamline regulations and remove unworkable ‘green tape’ so that food production can be expanded where appropriate."
201008,63,63810,897,NA,NA,Australians also need to be better informed about the basic cost of producing their food and fibre supplies.
201008,63,63810,898,NA,NA,"We need to inform the public more effectively about the factors which influence prices, and the very real benefits to consumers of choosing Australian produce."
201008,63,63810,899,NA,NA,We will strengthen ‘truth in labelling laws’ to help buyers make their purchasing decisions.
201008,63,63810,900,NA,NA,"The Nationals will continue to support regional forestry agreements, as instruments which provide resource security, best practice land use, and sustainability."
201008,63,63810,902,NA,NA,"Mining, agriculture and tourism are Australia’s key export industries."
201008,63,63810,903,NA,NA,"Forestry is an important import replacing industry, with our trade deficit in forest products running at about $2 billion a year.  Generally our primary industries co-exist peacefully, and the infrastructure developed for one provides benefits for the others."
201008,63,63810,904,NA,NA,"In recent years, conflict has arisen about mining access to agricultural land - in particular to prime agricultural land – and between the respective claims of forestry and agriculture in high rainfall areas."
201008,63,63810,905,NA,NA,"State Labor governments, especially in Queensland and New South Wales, have sold off mining and exploration rights, which grant land-use priority over agriculture."
201008,63,63810,906,NA,NA,"In the case of forestry, taxation incentives provided through managed investment schemes gave forestry (and some horticulture schemes) an unfair tax advantage over traditional farming operations and thus distorted investment and markets."
201008,63,63810,907,NA,NA,"Forestry now occupies only 0.4 per cent of Australia’s farmland, but this could rise to 6.2 per cent by 2020 if the Labor Government’s desired Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) is introduced."
201008,63,63810,908,NA,NA,"These conflicts create risks for Australia’s long-term food security, water management, social and physical environment, and threaten Australia’s bio diversity. Unless addressed now, these pressures will escalate."
201008,63,63810,909,NA,NA,"While land use is predominantly (and constitutionally) a matter for the States, The Nationals believe that there is a national responsibility to develop national solutions which deal fairly with all parties."
201008,63,63810,911,NA,NA,Re-establish a pre-eminent land and water research body.
201008,63,63810,912,NA,NA,"Charge this body with establishing, in consultation with the States and farming and forestry organisations, a national definition of ‘prime agricultural land’, based on such factors as moisture availability, temperature regime, chemical balance, permeability, surface composition, soil type, susceptibility to flooding, and erosion characteristics."
201008,63,63810,913,NA,NA,"Fund the identification of prime agricultural land, working through the Australia-wide network of catchment management agencies."
201008,63,63810,914,NA,NA,"While recognising the limits of the Australian Government’s constitutional powers, limit, and where appropriate prevent, surface mining on prime agricultural land."
201008,63,63810,915,NA,NA,"Underground mining will be permitted only where it can be shown conclusively that the hydrological balance is not affected, groundwater will not be polluted, and significant surface subsidence will not occur."
201008,63,63810,916,NA,NA,"Require that all agricultural land subject to surface mining be rehabilitated to the approximate original contours, and to its original or better productivity."
201008,63,63810,917,NA,NA,"Establish a working party including representatives of the mining, forestry and farming industries, to further define these conditions and progress their implementation."
201008,63,63810,918,NA,NA,"In conjunction with the farming and forestry industries, identify criteria for lands where broad scale forestry ought to be encouraged, and include these criteria in catchment management plans."
201008,63,63810,919,NA,NA,"Develop equivalent and non-discriminatory incentives for investment in agricultural and forestry activities, in consultation with those industries."
201008,63,63810,920,NA,NA,Amend taxation law so that passive investors in management investment schemes do not receive tax deductibility.
201008,63,63810,921,NA,NA,Australia’s Major Food Bowls
201008,63,63810,922,NA,NA,"The Murray-Darling Basin is the nation’s greatest food producing resource and is home to two million people. The communities in the Basin are under threat, not only from droughts and a drier climate, but from government policies.  Particularly ill advised is the Labor Government’s $4 billion ad hoc water buy-back adventure."
201008,63,63810,923,NA,NA,The Nationals will require socio-economic impact statements before any more water is bought within the Basin.
201008,63,63810,924,NA,NA,"The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will be consulted prior to any purchase and ABARE (the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics) will undertake an assessment of the impacts of any buy backs."
201008,63,63810,925,NA,NA,"The focus of Murray-Darling Basin policy must be the funding of infrastructure efficiencies; both in-system and on-farm, with water entitlement buy backs used only as a last resort."
201008,63,63810,926,NA,NA,"We must ensure that more water is returned to the environment,"
201008,63,63810,927,NA,NA,"enable farmers to produce more food and fibre from less water,"
201008,63,63810,928,NA,NA,"while protecting simultaneously the environment, communities, and regional economies."
201008,63,63810,929,NA,NA,We must also actively encourage the growth of agriculture in Northern Australia as a potential emerging food bowl.
201008,63,63810,930,NA,NA,"With predictions that the climate will become drier in Southern Australia and wetter in the North, the North will need to be developed to its food producing potential."
201008,63,63810,931,NA,NA,"The Nationals will partner the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to secure sustainable agriculture development in the north,"
201008,63,63810,932,NA,NA,with first priority on resolving the environmental and indigenous policy issues which are currently limiting the development of Northern Australia.
201008,63,63810,933,NA,NA,"The Nationals will commission a major independent study to examine the social, economic and environmental viability of making better use of water in the north, and will renew investigations into the practicality of transporting water southward."
201008,63,63810,935,NA,NA,"The Nationals believe that some droughts, fires and floods are truly exceptional, and no land manager can be fully prepared for them."
201008,63,63810,936,NA,NA,Our objective is to enable primary producers to return to full production as quickly as possible.
201008,63,63810,937,NA,NA,"The Nationals will continue to support farmers with targeted assistance during a one in 25 year drought, or a major flood or fire, both during the current drought and in the future."
201008,63,63810,938,NA,NA,"The Nationals will also invest in practical on-ground preparedness, including, where appropriate, flood and fire mitigation, and will boost research and development on new plant varieties and management practices to increase farm productivity."
201008,63,63810,939,NA,NA,"We will review the Australian Plague Locust Commission, to ensure that its funding and governance are adequate to deal with rapidly emerging threats."
201008,63,63810,941,NA,NA,"The many challenges confronting Australian primary producers include climate variability; local and exotic pests, weeds and diseases; increased consumer demand for greener, fresher, tastier and cheaper food; and increasingly expensive inputs including water, fuel, fertilisers, chemicals, labour and energy."
201008,63,63810,942,NA,NA,"The Nationals recognise the importance of research into climate variability, founded on scientific merit."
201008,63,63810,943,NA,NA,"We will focus on those specific research projects with the potential to revolutionise agriculture, fisheries or forestry production."
201008,63,63810,944,NA,NA,"For example, we will accelerate research into perennial cereal crops, particularly wheat, which are disease resistant, high yielding, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, are water efficient/drought resistant, and can produce high protein grain."
201008,63,63810,945,NA,NA,The agriculture sector has the best take up rate of new technologies and production systems of any of our industries.

201008,63,63810,951,NA,NA,"The food industry is the nation’s largest manufacturing sector, and employs more than 200,000 Australians, half of them in rural and regional areas."
201008,63,63810,952,NA,NA,"It accounts for about 2.5 per cent of GDP, yet there is little understanding of the food chain among governments, the community, manufacturers, processors and even farmers."
201008,63,63810,953,NA,NA,"The Nationals believe that the food manufacturing, retail and food services industries are a vital part of the economic fabric of the Australian economy, and that they will become increasingly important."
201008,63,63810,954,NA,NA,"To reflect that importance, we have a separate policy on food security."
201008,63,63810,955,NA,NA,"The Nationals will expand the existing Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio to include a major role for Food and Food Security."

201008,63,63810,962,NA,NA,Most developed countries have adopted ‘security of supply’ policies to ensure adequate fuel and food is available in the case of major natural disaster or act of aggression.
201008,63,63810,963,NA,NA,"An outbreak of influenza, a major terrorism attack, or a severe climatic event may occur seldom, but clear plans need to be put in place for their eventuality."
201008,63,63810,964,NA,NA,"The Nationals will introduce polices to ensure Australia is able to meet its food requirements by adopting practical measures to protect the supply chain, such as decentralised food distribution hubs, and secure alternative road and rail networks."
201008,63,63810,965,NA,NA,These fallback options will support the health and safety measures necessary to meet a national environmental or security emergency.

201008,63,63810,973,NA,NA,The Nationals’ practical approach to primary production issues will enable Australia to play its proper and increasingly important role in the world economy.
201008,63,63810,977,NA,NA,"Global demand for food continues to rise, yet water and available land for food production are diminishing. Metropolitan areas now use up to half the water once available to cultivate food, while ground water levels are declining."
201008,63,63810,978,NA,NA,"Access to good farm land is flagging because of a decline in soil fertility in existing holdings, and pressure not to open new areas for cultivation."
201008,63,63810,979,NA,NA,"Reports from the United Nations, world health authorities and aid agencies call for the same thing - greater production using fewer natural resources."
201008,63,63810,980,NA,NA,"Australia, as one of the most active producers and exporters of food, needs to think more strategically about its food supply. Securing our food supply is intrinsically linked to Australia’s national and economic security."
201008,63,63810,982,NA,NA,Current investment in developing and protecting the Australian farm sector does not recognise the large contribution farmers make to our economy.

201008,63,63810,984,NA,NA,"Government investment in food production technologies, in infrastructure as well as distribution networks, is well below what it should be in Australia."
201008,63,63810,985,NA,NA,"The Labor Government has cut $30 million from Advancing Australian Agriculture - a program designed to improve farm productivity, and has forced the CSIRO to reduce its spending on food production research."
201008,63,63810,986,NA,NA,"Water trading schemes, buy backs, and the preoccupation with locking land and ocean away from productive use have become Labor’s policy response to the pending food crisis."
201008,63,63810,987,NA,NA,"These policies are stifling sustainable growth in the farming sector. Priority must be returned to communities and businesses which assist in the production of food, and to encouraging farming as an essential enterprise."

201008,63,63810,1025,NA,NA,A sound strategic plan for Australia’s food security benefits regional communities and all Australians.
201008,63,63810,1026,NA,NA,Our policies assist farmers to ‘think smarter’ about production and will foster a strong commitment to agricultural research which in turn will ensure food security.
201008,63,63810,1027,NA,NA,Feeding our nation and fulfilling our trade obligations is a fundamental challenge to be addressed.
201008,63,63810,1028,NA,NA,"The Nationals will act now, to provide the nation with a new focus in policy direction, and to maintain a crucial advantage which we have too long taken for granted: the nation’s food security."
201008,63,63810,1032,NA,NA,"The Nationals is the Party of, and the Party for, small business."
201008,63,63810,1033,NA,NA,We recognise that regional Australia depends on small business to drive its economy and regional prosperity.
201008,63,63810,1034,NA,NA,"In recent years, there has been a major diversification in the activity undertaken by small businesses in regional Australia - a move away from a mainly rural based industry structure to include services, tourism and manufacturing."
201008,63,63810,1035,NA,NA,The majority of businesses in regional Australia employ fewer than 20 people but between them the sector is the largest employer.
201008,63,63810,1036,NA,NA,"Of the 1,880,000 small businesses throughout Australia, some 35 per cent – more than 650,000 – operate in regional Australia."
201008,63,63810,1037,NA,NA,"In order to be competitive, small businesses in regional Australia must have the same opportunities to gain the benefits of technology as in the capital cities."
201008,63,63810,1038,NA,NA,"This is especially the case with tourism, where regional Australia struggles to get its share of the international visitor market."
201008,63,63810,1039,NA,NA,The ratio of domestic to international visitors in the regions is as high as 19:1.
201008,63,63810,1040,NA,NA,"While Australia as a whole is seen as a desirable destination, the major cities and east coast derive most of the benefits."
201008,63,63810,1042,NA,NA,"Under Labor, the flexibility small business needs is constrained by forced and formal negotiation with unions, rather than by talking things through with employees."
201008,63,63810,1043,NA,NA,"Contractors in particular are discriminated against, as Labor denies them the right to work for themselves."
201008,63,63810,1044,NA,NA,Labor’s antipathy to small business has resulted in the removal of reasonable protection for small businesses forced to dismiss non-performing or redundant employees.
201008,63,63810,1045,NA,NA,"Labor offers special funding arrangements for big property developers, and subsidies for multinational car makers, but does little to help small regional businesses in difficult times."
201008,63,63810,1046,NA,NA,"Most of all, Labor’s failure to address the infrastructure, telecommunications, health and education needs of regional people, and its withdrawal of services to small business in the regions, has resulted in our regional businesses becoming second class citizens."
201008,63,63810,1049,NA,NA,"Upgrade education, health and transport infrastructure"

201008,63,63810,1054,NA,NA,"The Nationals recognise that success in maintaining existing businesses and attracting business people to relocate to regional Australia depends on education, health, infrastructure and transport."
201008,63,63810,1055,NA,NA,"The Nationals aim to give small businesses the competitive environment and the tools they need to make the best of opportunities, in both domestic and international markets."
201008,63,63810,1056,NA,NA,We will work with industry associations and academic institutions to develop small business education programs aimed at increasing efficiency and productivity.
201008,63,63810,1057,NA,NA,"The vast number of interlocking and confusing regulations covering business activity at the Federal, State and local levels must be simplified."
201008,63,63810,1058,NA,NA,The Nationals commit to reinvigorating previous programs to remove red tape at all levels of government.
201008,63,63810,1059,NA,NA,"This includes combating the indirect red tape which results from restrictions imposed by government on other businesses such as financial institutions, which then is carried through to their small business clients."
201008,63,63810,1060,NA,NA,The Nationals will continue their leadership role in ensuring that small business can compete on a level playing field with bigger businesses.
201008,63,63810,1061,NA,NA,"Healthy competition is good, but small businesses must be protected from unfair competition by powerful resource-rich companies."
201008,63,63810,1062,NA,NA,The Nationals have taken the lead in addressing deficiencies in the Trade Practices Act and will continue to address weaknesses in Trade Practices legislation affecting small business competitiveness.
201008,63,63810,1063,NA,NA,We will also better resource the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take action against large corporations which abuse their market power.
201008,63,63810,1064,NA,NA,Many economic and social advantages are evident for businesses operating in regional areas.
201008,63,63810,1065,NA,NA,The Nationals will support initiatives to make city businesses aware of these advantages and to encourage Australians to enjoy the benefits of a non-metropolitan lifestyle.
201008,63,63810,1066,NA,NA,"The Nationals will also undertake a review of the effect of additional costs on businesses outside the capital cities, with a view to determining what regional incentives could be introduced to encourage businesses to relocate from the capital cities."
201008,63,63810,1067,NA,NA,"The Nationals in Government will provide a 30 per cent investment allowance to assist small business in regional areas to expand and to create jobs, or for capital city businesses to relocate."
201008,63,63810,1068,NA,NA,"The allowance will be for increasing business capacity, such as major new plant acquisitions or increasing production capacity."
201008,63,63810,1069,NA,NA,It will be subject to requirements such as job creation benchmarks and output increases.
201008,63,63810,1070,NA,NA,The program will exclude passive investment such as commercial property investment for lease.
201008,63,63810,1072,NA,NA,The Nationals support the rationalisation and updating of industrial awards and the introduction of greater flexibility.
201008,63,63810,1073,NA,NA,"Small businesses are generally more reliant on the award structure than larger businesses, and more so in the regions."
201008,63,63810,1074,NA,NA,The Nationals do not support Labor’s objective of removing pay differentials between different parts of Australia or the imposition of common penalty rates.
201008,63,63810,1075,NA,NA,"Unlike Labor, The Nationals understand that strawberries do not only ripen between 9am and 5pm on weekdays; that prawn trawler crews do not come home for dinner every evening; that country shows are generally held on public holidays; and that family wineries do most of their business on weekends."
201008,63,63810,1076,NA,NA,The Nationals in government will instruct the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to recognise the special circumstances of businesses operating outside the major capital cities and to establish a pay structure accordingly.
201008,63,63810,1078,NA,NA,The Nationals support a Small Business Action Plan to respond to fluctuations in the global economy.  Measures will include:
201008,63,63810,1079,NA,NA,"Tax loss carry-back to allow businesses to offset operating losses and retain staff by claiming back taxes paid over the past three years, up to a $100,000 limit;"
201008,63,63810,1080,NA,NA,"OECD-best practice regulation, whereby the Commonwealth will undertake a comprehensive audit of all the Federal, State and local paperwork needed to start or expand a business and will ensure that this overhead burden is reduced to at least match OECD best practice;"
201008,63,63810,1081,NA,NA,"A one-stop-shop regulation portal, to deliver integrated on-line access to all forms and filings, regardless of the level of government which imposes them; and"
201008,63,63810,1082,NA,NA,"Support for family businesses, to provide support and advice for family businesses on succession planning and family business development."
201008,63,63810,1084,NA,NA,Local tourism in regional Australia needs to be supported by vocational and professional training of tourism operators and suppliers.
201008,63,63810,1085,NA,NA,"There is no shortage of research available in Australia, but there is a gap between the data and how it is used."
201008,63,63810,1086,NA,NA,"Education of tour operators, tourism outlets and the commercial sector is vital to take advantage of the information available."
201008,63,63810,1087,NA,NA,"The Nationals support the establishment of a regional tourism training initiative to improve the skills and professional standards of tourism operators, and to assist them to meet the particular challenges presented by regional tourist activities."
201008,63,63810,1088,NA,NA,"The initiative would encompass a number of programs to meet the needs of various tourism industry sectors, such as:"
201008,63,63810,1089,NA,NA,"Grants to existing and new tourist operators of farm stays, motels, B&Bs, and wineries for training in marketing and promotion, with particular emphasis on on-line marketing;"
201008,63,63810,1090,NA,NA,"Training rebates for travel agents and tourism operators who undertake a training course or accreditation in regional tourism, based on the number of bed nights they sell into regional Australia within a prescribed period;"
201008,63,63810,1091,NA,NA,"A national database and rating system, similar to the motel star system, listing tourism businesses and outlets which successfully complete vocational training courses related to tourism; and"
201008,63,63810,1092,NA,NA,"Funding for specific regional education tours for major tourism operators, similar to the programs now conducted by other countries, to enable travel consultants to gain a better understanding of what is on offer."
201008,63,63810,1093,NA,NA,"Many regional community, cultural and sporting events need government support from time to time, as the regional economy ebbs and flows."
201008,63,63810,1094,NA,NA,"Support is currently available only in an ad hoc manner, from governments and government business entities."
201008,63,63810,1095,NA,NA,"The future of the Australian Tourism Development Program, and Federal Government funding of tourism activities is uncertain."
201008,63,63810,1096,NA,NA,"While local government bears the brunt of the cost of tourism promotion in the regions, many local governments cannot afford to provide funding on a consistent and continuing basis."
201008,63,63810,1097,NA,NA,The Nationals believe that all levels of government must commit to funding tourist promotion and that the Federal Government should play a leading role.
201008,63,63810,1098,NA,NA,Regions need consistent support to compete at an international level.
201008,63,63810,1099,NA,NA,"The Nationals support the establishment of a Federal tourism fund, to provide project-specific grants to support regional promotion campaigns or major regional tourism and entertainment events."
201008,63,63810,1100,NA,NA,"The grants process will be competitive, with a major criterion being the ability of the project to generate long-term shifts in tourist behaviour."
201008,63,63810,1102,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ policies continue to be directed to ensuring that small businesses get a fair go, and that they have ways and means to be competitive and successful."
201008,63,63810,1103,NA,NA,We place particular emphasis on encouraging more small businesses to relocate from the capital cities to regional Australia and helping existing businesses to grow and prosper.
201008,63,63810,1104,NA,NA,Tourism has the potential to make a more major contribution to the economic future of many regional communities.
201008,63,63810,1105,NA,NA,"To realise that potential, regional tourism operators and service providers need the skills and qualifications to market regional Australia effectively."
201008,63,63810,1109,NA,NA,Trade is a major engine of growth for regional Australia.
201008,63,63810,1110,NA,NA,"It creates new jobs, improves living standards, and ensures our future as a prosperous nation."
201008,63,63810,1111,NA,NA,One in four jobs in regional Australia is directly or indirectly linked to exports.
201008,63,63810,1112,NA,NA,"When The Nationals were in government, exports from regional Australia grew three times faster than did exports from major cities."
201008,63,63810,1113,NA,NA,About a quarter of regional Australia’s income now comes from exports.
201008,63,63810,1114,NA,NA,"Trade is a two-way street. Australia will continue to import the finance, technology and innovation needed to develop the country and to make our industries more competitive."
201008,63,63810,1115,NA,NA,"We also need to import consumer goods we do not produce, and to use imports to ensure yearround supplies of seasonal foods."
201008,63,63810,1116,NA,NA,"It is essential that Australia’s quarantine and inspection services receive sufficient funding and support to counter any pest or disease threats which imports may pose, and to ensure that our products being exported are of the highest standard and meet the requirements of our export markets."
201008,63,63810,1117,NA,NA,"Only The Nationals can ensure that regional Australia receives its fair share of the benefits generated by our export industries, and that the regions are provided with the infrastructure and services necessary for these export industries to grow and prosper."
201008,63,63810,1118,NA,NA,"We will fight to ensure better access to international markets for our farmers, manufacturers, miners and service providers."
201008,63,63810,1119,NA,NA,We will ensure that our quarantine services are properly resourced to protect Australia’s disease-free status.

201008,63,63810,1125,NA,NA,"Labor terminated The Nationals’ plan to provide highspeed broadband to regional Australia by 2010, leaving our regional exporters without access to this vital business tool."
201008,63,63810,1126,NA,NA,"New spending on roads, rail and ports ground to a halt, as Labor investigated, consulted, inquired – and postponed."
201008,63,63810,1127,NA,NA,"Labor’s economic mismanagement and procrastination are costing regional Australia’s exporters dearly, and its close relationship with the unions undermines the efficiency of our wharves and other points of export."
201008,63,63810,1128,NA,NA,"The results are a less competitive export sector, greater reliance on imports, higher prices, higher debt and higher taxes for all Australians."

201008,63,63810,1160,NA,NA,The Nationals have a proud record of achieving results for exporting businesses in regional Australia.
201008,63,63810,1161,NA,NA,We will not stand by while Labor trashes both that achievement and the future prosperity of regional Australia.
201008,63,63810,1165,NA,NA,The Nationals’ philosophy calls for a fair go for all Australians.

201008,63,63810,1172,NA,NA,"Most of all, Labor has failed in managing the economy, leaving a massive debt."
201008,63,63810,1173,NA,NA,"Rather than building new hospitals and new aged care facilities, we will now be paying interest to international lenders."
201008,63,63810,1174,NA,NA,Labor fails to understand that it is only sound economic management that allows the delivery of social services and support for the needy.

201309,63,63110,74,NA,NA,The recent modification of the boundaries of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area to include forests of high conservation and World Heritage value was driven in the federal Parliament by former leader Bob Brown and current Greens leader Christine Milne.

201309,63,63110,78,NA,NA,The whole nuclear-fuel chain – from uranium mining to the unresolved problem of nuclear waste – presents unacceptable environmental and security risks and is phenomenally expensive.
201309,63,63110,79,NA,NA,"Rather than leaving future generations the burden of nuclear waste, we should be giving them truly safe, clean, timely and economic solutions to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions."

201309,63,63110,85,NA,NA,The Australian Greens have introduced a bill that would ban live exports.
201309,63,63110,86,NA,NA,We support a transition away from live exports to the sustainable chilled meat industry.

201309,63,63110,93,NA,NA,"The Labor government and the Coalition rejected the Australian Heritage Council’s recommendation to protect the Tarkine, preferring instead to declare it open for mining, putting the Tasmanian devil closer to extinction."
201309,63,63110,94,NA,NA,"There are at least 10 new mines proposed for the Tarkine, including the Shree Minerals iron ore mine and three huge open-cut mines proposed by Venture Minerals."

201309,63,63110,108,NA,NA,The Minerals Resource Rent Tax was supposed to be a tax that spread the benefits of the boom”.
201309,63,63110,109,NA,NA,Yet it will raise only $200 million in its first year.
201309,63,63110,110,NA,NA,This is a direct result of Labor’s failure to stand up to the big mining companies.
201309,63,63110,111,NA,NA,It doesn’t have to be this way.
201309,63,63110,112,NA,NA,"Despite talk of the end of the mining boom, industry profits remain at historically high levels and mining companies will continue to make billions for their overseas shareholders from the resources we all own."
201309,63,63110,113,NA,NA,The Australian Greens’ proposals to fix the mining tax will raise an additional $21.8 billion over three years to be invested in the Australian community.
201309,63,63110,115,NA,NA,The gap between rich and poor in Australia is growing.
201309,63,63110,116,NA,NA,Those who earn enough to be classified millionaires don’t face the same pressures as the rest of the community.
201309,63,63110,117,NA,NA,An effective tax rate of 50% on income over $1 million will make our tax system fairer and contribute more than $0.5 billion to making a more caring society.
201309,63,63110,118,NA,NA,"(This only applies to the select few people with incomes of more than $1 million a year, not to assets like the family home or farm.)"
201309,63,63110,120,NA,NA,"Our big banks are making record profits, around $24 billion in the past year."
201309,63,63110,121,NA,NA,These record profits off the back of consumers are underpinned by an implicit ‘too big to fail’ guarantee from the government.
201309,63,63110,122,NA,NA,If the banks went to the wall the taxpayer would bail them out.
201309,63,63110,123,NA,NA,The big four banks are taking all of the profits while the taxpayers are wearing all of the risk.
201309,63,63110,124,NA,NA,"Based on similar levies in Europe and the United States, the Australian Greens propose a 0.2% levy on bank assets in excess of $100 billion which will raise $8.4 billion over three years."
201309,63,63110,125,NA,NA,"Because it only applies to the big four banks and not their competitors, competitive pressures will stop the big four passing the levy on to consumers."
201309,63,63110,126,NA,NA,It is time the big four banks paid a fair contribution for the public support they receive.
201309,63,63110,128,NA,NA,Large corporations and wealthy business people exercise too much power over our governments.
201309,63,63110,129,NA,NA,"The formation of our current mining tax was a debacle, where three of the biggest mining companies in the world — BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata — ran rings around Labor."
201309,63,63110,130,NA,NA,"In the process, those three big companies looked after their own interests but left the Australian people out of pocket by billions — and demonstrated the influence of lobbyists."
201309,63,63110,131,NA,NA,In NSW the corruption hearings demonstrate we must be ever vigilant.
201309,63,63110,132,NA,NA,This is why the Greens are proposing a National Anti-Corruption Commission and greater transparency for corporate lobbyists.
201309,63,63110,133,NA,NA,"The economy should serve the people and look after the environment, not the other way around."
201309,63,63110,134,NA,NA,Labor and Tony Abbott don’t have the backbone to stand up to the mining corporations and big business.
201309,63,63110,135,NA,NA,"Only the Greens have the economic plans to build on our environment, grow the clean economy and care for people."

201309,63,63110,143,NA,NA,"Already, we are seeing extreme summer heat, breaking record after record."
201309,63,63110,144,NA,NA,"If we do nothing, we can expect catastrophic droughts, floods, heat waves, cyclones and bushfires."
201309,63,63110,145,NA,NA,"Climate change is a global crisis which profoundly threatens our economy, society, people’s health, our Great Barrier Reef, fellow species like polar bears, and our way of life."
201309,63,63110,146,NA,NA,That’s why the Greens made cutting the pollution that drives global warming a condition of supporting the government in 2010.
201309,63,63110,147,NA,NA,And that’s how we negotiated the visionary Clean Energy Act.
201309,63,63110,148,NA,NA,It’s working.
201309,63,63110,149,NA,NA,"The Clean Energy Act is bringing down pollution by charging big companies to pollute and investing that money in clean energy, and helping people and local communities save energy."
201309,63,63110,150,NA,NA,Cutting pollution isn’t just about preventing a climate crisis.
201309,63,63110,151,NA,NA,"It helps us build a more caring, healthy and innovative Australia."
201309,63,63110,152,NA,NA,Cutting pollution means cleaner air and cleaner water for all of us.
201309,63,63110,153,NA,NA,Neither Labor nor the Coalition can be trusted to take real action to cut the pollution that drives global warming.
201309,63,63110,154,NA,NA,Tony Abbott’s plans would be a disaster.
201309,63,63110,155,NA,NA,"Ripping up the Clean Energy Act would give the big polluting companies free rein, ending support for clean energy."
201309,63,63110,156,NA,NA,"Though Labor joined with us to pass the Clean Energy package, they can’t be relied on to protect the price on pollution or not weaken action on global warming."
201309,63,63110,157,NA,NA,"At a federal level, Labor has never said no to a mining company that wants to frack for coal-seam gas or expand a massive coal mine."
201309,63,63110,158,NA,NA,Both Labor and the Coalition are risking jobs and investment when the world decides it doesn’t want our coal.
201309,63,63110,159,NA,NA,The Greens in Parliament are essential to stand up for real action on global warming.
201309,63,63110,160,NA,NA,We will continue to cut pollution and make clean energy cheaper.
201309,63,63110,162,NA,NA,The government spends billions on tax breaks to the big mining corporations and fossil fuel industry.
201309,63,63110,163,NA,NA,"In the past budget, for example, it continued to provide diesel fuel subsidies, exploration subsidies, and many other write-offs which make it cheaper and easier — via the public purse — for big miners to make record profits."
201309,63,63110,164,NA,NA,"Worse, these billions of dollars in subsidies are fuelling global warming by making it cheaper for big mining corporations to pollute and to extract more and more coal, oil and gas."
201309,63,63110,165,NA,NA,"The Australian Greens will reinvest over $12 billion from abolishing key tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry into the smart, clean industries for the future."
201309,63,63110,166,NA,NA,Labor cannot be trusted to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and the Abbott Opposition wants to give them a free ride but the Greens aren’t afraid to end these hand-outs for billionaire companies and invest the money into the economy of the future.
201309,63,63110,168,NA,NA,A caring society looks after the health of its people and the environment.

201309,63,63620,789,NA,NA,The Coalition has a long track record of managing Budgets responsibly
201309,63,63620,790,NA,NA,Sixteen members of the Shadow Cabinet were experienced Ministers in the effective Howard Coalition Government

201309,63,63620,792,NA,NA,"and a safe, secure Australia.”"
201309,63,63710,2,NA,NA,The economy is completely underwritten by the energy market in Australia
201309,63,63710,3,NA,NA,The challenge remains to provide adequate supply cheaply for today’s consumers while ensuring that the impact of the generation and consumption of that energy is not unfairly borne by future generations
201309,63,63710,4,NA,NA,"The energy market in Australia is complex and encompasses all forms from liquid, gas and solid fuel systems to renewables like solar, hydro, wind and geothermal systems"
201309,63,63710,5,NA,NA,The consumption of energy is also wide ranging in utilisation of electricity for stationary applications to fuels for transport and industry
201309,63,63710,6,NA,NA,"From a consumptive perspective the major energy products consumed in Australia are approximately coal (37%), oil products (35%), gas (23%) and renewables (5%)"
201309,63,63710,7,NA,NA,"Electricity has been primarily the domain of state governments historically, however increasingly the emergence of the interstate transmission grid has shifted the responsibility"
201309,63,63710,8,NA,NA,Increasingly there is an emerging conflict between corporatisation and full privatisation of electricity assets
201309,63,63710,9,NA,NA,The ownership of generation and transmission assets is of primary concern to the national interests of Australia and a rethink of the role of the federal government in this space is now warranted
201309,63,63710,10,NA,NA,Approximately 85% of Australian electricity is currently generated on simple cycle thermal coal fired power stations
201309,63,63710,11,NA,NA,This generation technology is nearly a century old and the full impacts of this generation system will not be fully borne for generations to come
201309,63,63710,12,NA,NA,"Notwithstanding the long term impacts of relatively inefficient generation of 33% in energy conversion, the current electricity prices do not include capital or replacement costs for the fleet of generators that are fast approaching their decommissioning as they literally wear out"
201309,63,63710,13,NA,NA,Major generators are now coming off line and increasingly running below capacity
201309,63,63710,14,NA,NA,It is becoming urgent to make decisions on infrastructure in this sector to ensure the Australian economy is not exposed to increasing volatility in supply and price of electricity
201309,63,63710,15,NA,NA,rNewer generation technologies must be incorporated to dramatically reduce the climate impact of our electricity needs
201309,63,63710,16,NA,NA,"For example, combined cycle gas turbines are much more efficient generators in the energy conversion sense, approaching 60%, effectively halving greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt hour"
201309,63,63710,17,NA,NA,However there needs to be a much greater emphasis on incorporating renewables and newer technologies into the generation mix to replace the ageing fleet of generators in an orderly fashion without exposing the economy to price or supply shocks
201309,63,63710,18,NA,NA,"Beyond electricity, Australian energy demands are massive in the form of oil and gas products"
201309,63,63710,19,NA,NA,Currently Australia consumes approximately 18. 5 billion litres of diesel and 2. 7 billion litres of petrol annually
201309,63,63710,20,NA,NA,"Intuitively diesel is more geared to commerce and industry with mining consuming approximately 30%, transport approximately 35% and agriculture about 2% of annual diesel usage"
201309,63,63710,21,NA,NA,"Gas consumption currently stands at approximately 210,000 GJ of which manufacturing consumes approximately 40% and electricity and heating consume approximately 42%"
201309,63,63710,22,NA,NA,Clearly Australia is heavily dependent on fossil fuels to meet current demand

201309,63,63710,75,NA,NA,One of the main triggers for the sale of public infrastructure is the run down in these assets and associated ongoing maintenance and renewal costs

201309,63,63710,77,NA,NA,"Often the real strategic value of the assets is not realised which means the tax payer ends up paying for the initial asset and subsequently, once the asset is privatised, paying for it again to the new commercial owners who seek a handsome profit on an asset that has been subsidised to them by the tax payer"
201309,63,63710,78,NA,NA,The decision to sell assets is often short-term rationale in relation to election cycle budget timeframes

201309,63,63710,100,NA,NA,The subsequent culture of self-assessment by Government has in effect created a feedback loop that reinforces the bureaucratic system to amplify it’s disconnect from the expectations and needs of the non-government sector
201309,63,63710,101,NA,NA,In addition there appears to be an increasing trend to politicise investment strategies that severely curtail necessary rigour in costing and assessing impacts of public investment programs
201309,63,63710,102,NA,NA,The political hype around the NBN is an excellent example of the politicisation of public investment with overstated benefits of fibre to home infrastructure and gross incompetence with underestimated costs and a subsequent blowout of over fifty billion dollars

201309,63,63710,120,NA,NA,This high level of scientific agreement is very unusual and other debates that have ultimately been resolved into widespread agreement have generally achieved a considerably lower level of scientific consensus.
201309,63,63710,121,NA,NA,This is cause for considerable concern because our civilisation depends on climate stability in order to support the current global human population.
201309,63,63710,122,NA,NA,Global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are now higher than at any time during the last 3 million years.
201309,63,63710,123,NA,NA,These high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are also impacting on carbon dioxide levels dissolved in sea water with resultant impacts on pH and likely dramatic ramifications for the entire oceanic food chain.
201309,63,63710,124,NA,NA,"In view of the above points, KAP adopts the precautionary principle and agrees that global carbon dioxide emissions will ultimately need to be constrained to some degree. |  "
201309,63,63710,125,NA,NA,Those constraints on emissions should remain in place unless or until such time that it can be reliably and scientifically demonstrated that unconstrained carbon dioxide emissions are unlikely to result in costly climatic disturbances.
201309,63,63710,126,NA,NA,"In regard to the development of new power generation infrastructure, the cost of wind and solar energy systems will be no greater than fossil fuel generation systems."

201309,63,63710,128,NA,NA,"These are critical points because renewables are often painted as expensive when compared to fully depreciated forty plus year old fossil fuel plants, but this simplistic cost comparison is not borne out when we fairly compare the cost of renewables against capital cost of new fossil fuel systems required to replace the ageing fleet or meet new demand."
201309,63,63710,129,NA,NA,"There is, however, an ongoing demand for fossil fuels and KAP is committed to responsibly exploit the current energy market to maximise Australia’s competitive advantage in the provision of cleanest possible fossil fuels to meet the ongoing demand for as long as it persists to ensure the best possible economic outcome for Australia and to extend the jobs in the current energy sector."
201309,63,63710,130,NA,NA,More broadly the same precautionary principles should be applied to other areas of environmental stewardship in relation to mining and extractive industries as well as other areas of human intervention on the land.

201309,63,63710,139,NA,NA,The reality is that the wealth of this nation was first defined in agricultural terms and it is fast returning as the driver of our future prosperity.
201309,63,63710,140,NA,NA,The rural and regional economy of Australia is increasingly dependent on farmers’ prosperity.
201309,63,63710,141,NA,NA,"Similarly, as the resources boom begins to slow, the national economy is dependent on the export of Australian produce to bring in export income and provide a major injection of capital to the national economy to underpin sustainable economic growth."

201309,63,63710,143,NA,NA,"Australia is one of the few countries that expects its agricultural producers to subsidise consumers domestically and internationally, by being forced to compete in markets with foreign producers who are heavily subsidised to increase production with little or no exposure to market or production risk."
201309,63,63710,144,NA,NA,"In 1996, the National Farmers Federation (NFF) posed a question: “Why have farmers’ high productivity performance not translated to a more satisfactory profitability outcome for Australian farmers?” "

201309,63,63710,148,NA,NA,This trend demonstrates market failure in the agricultural sector.
201309,63,63710,149,NA,NA,The result of successive government to deregulate agricultural market arrangements has seen increasing market power in the post farm gate sector of the supply chain and structural change that moves the profit in agriculture away from the producers.
201309,63,63710,150,NA,NA,"Again, gross farm debt has been increasing steadily while net farm income remains constant."
201309,63,63710,151,NA,NA,This trend highlights the failure of agricultural market reform in Australia to deliver any benefit to the farm sector.

201309,63,63710,153,NA,NA,"Fundamentally though, the reality is that no central government in the world wants food prices to increase and the majority of the population growth is unlikely to be able to pay even the true cost of production for their food."
201309,63,63710,154,NA,NA,"Engel’s Law is an economic truism that has been proven repeatedly, proving that the proportion of income consumers spend on food does not increase in line with their increasing income."
201309,63,63710,155,NA,NA,"This phenomenon belies the notion that agriculture will benefit from increasing affluence in line with their inherent increasing agricultural production costs, which do not follow Engel’s Law."
201309,63,63710,156,NA,NA,"In effect, the agricultural economy will always fall behind the broader economy with the free market mentality that economic rationalists have so fervently and recklessly pursued."
201309,63,63710,157,NA,NA,"Free marketers are killing Australian agriculture and by extrapolation, rural and regional Australia and all industries that feed off it."
201309,63,63710,158,NA,NA,There is a public and politically promoted notion that it is the role of Australian farmers to meet the increasing global food challenge. 
201309,63,63710,159,NA,NA,"The reality is that Australian farmers are business people and their primary obligation is to feed, clothe and educate their own families and those who work for them."
201309,63,63710,160,NA,NA,This is becoming increasingly difficult. If society generally wants Australian farmers to feed the world then there needs to be a strong market signal sent that underpins the economic success of current and future farmers.

201309,63,63710,190,1,-1,"Firstly, the risk to life in making the perilous journey to Australia in barely seaworthy vessels is profound and unacceptable to both the migrants and the defence personnel deployed to intercept them."
201309,63,63710,191,1,-1,The humanitarian implications of this situation are very publicly on display and public policy failures are impacting on Australia’s humanitarian reputation internationally and domestically.
201309,63,63710,192,1,-1,"Secondly, the sheer number of people trying to enter Australia is placing an unmanageable burden on Australia’s systems to receive, shelter and process these people."
201309,63,63710,193,1,-1,"Again, the humanitarian implications of this situation are very publicly on display and public policy failures are impacting on Australia’s humanitarian reputation internationally and domestically."
201309,63,63710,194,1,-1,"Thirdly, the ease of entry and inability to process the asylum seekers adequately is now posing an unmanageable national security risk with evidence mounting that undeserving and undesirable individuals are being inappropriately assessed and managed by immigration and security personnel."
201309,63,63710,195,NA,NA,"Australian citizens are being forced to fund the entire program of interception, processing, transport and repatriation either in Australia or elsewhere."
201309,63,63710,196,1,-1,"In addition, national security is increasingly under pressure and the opportunity for entry by undesirables and the implications for Australian citizens if they are successful are profound."
201309,63,63710,197,1,-1,Genuine asylum seekers are being caught up in a wave of irregular maritime arrivals and Australia is unable to deal with their circumstances in an appropriate and compassionate way and timeframe.
201309,63,63710,198,1,-1,The success of the illegal transportation of people to Australia is providing an incentive to non-refugee aspirants.
201309,63,63710,199,1,-1,"In turn, this is creating a financial incentive to crews who transport them, placing all in harm’s way unduly."
201309,63,63710,200,1,0,KAP is obliged to address an asylum seeker policy.
201309,63,63710,202,1,-1,KAP is committed to meaningfully deter asylum seekers from boarding boats in Indonesia or any other country in order to seek asylum in Australia.
201309,63,63710,203,1,-1,"KAP is committed to mitigate the financial cost of asylum seeker interception processing, housing and repatriation to the Australian taxpayer."
201309,63,63710,204,NA,NA,KAP is committed to demonstrate humanitarian compassion in balance with deterring unacceptably dangerous irregular maritime arrivals.
201309,63,63710,205,1,0,KAP is also committed to reforming the processing of asylum seekers to end the extraordinary waste that is now expended in the industry that has sprung up around the detention of these people.
201309,63,63710,206,1,-1,It is clear that the current bureaucratic process is ineffective and that the Department has no real capacity to competently assess the legitimacy of the claims by asylum seekers.
201309,63,63710,207,1,-1,"It is apparent that this aspect of the asylum seeker issue is not being addressed, while it is perhaps the bigger source of apprehension for the Australian public."
201309,63,63710,208,1,-1,"Subject to an initial security and health screening, KAP would require that if asylum seekers are to be granted temporary visas, they only be allowed to enter the community on strict social contracts that compel them to close monitoring until such time as the Australian Government is satisfied they pose no threat."
201309,63,63710,209,2,1,"These temporary visas would also provide conditions in relation to settlement and assimilation into the Australian community, compelling a commitment to Australian culture, and compelling a productive contribution to the Australian economy."
201309,63,63710,210,NA,NA,Any breach of this kind of social contract would result in termination of the visa.

201309,63,63710,213,1,-1,Restrict Australia’s migration zone to the mainland.
201309,63,63710,214,1,-1,"Any boat found in Australian waters, that is seaworthy and carrying asylum seekers, shall be turned around and escorted out of Australian waters."
201309,63,63710,215,NA,NA,Any immediate humanitarian needs of passengers or crew shall be met at interception.
201309,63,63710,216,NA,NA,Suspected people smuggler ring leaders and organisers who benefit substantially financially should be prosecuted vigorously and they should defend themselves at their own expense.
201309,63,63710,217,1,0,Asylum seekers claims are assessed quickly to screen for health and obvious security risks.
201309,63,63710,218,2,-1,Successful refugees should only be granted temporary visas and conditional release into the community on a strict social contract subject to close electronic monitoring for a probationary period in lieu of detention.
201309,63,63710,219,2,-1,"Refugees on temporary visas should be employed/deployed in work for the dole type programs, particularly in the construction of their own housing and infrastructure requirements."
201309,63,63710,221,NA,NA,Australian Aboriginal people are undeniably our First Australians.
201309,63,63710,222,NA,NA,These people have struggled under colonisation.
201309,63,63710,223,NA,NA,There is no doubt that the socio-economic circumstances of modern Aboriginal people in Australia reflects poorly on their treatment and consideration by past and present governments.
201309,63,63710,224,NA,NA,"KAP is mindful of many appalling injustices that have been inflicted on the Aboriginal people and while there is awareness of these issues, the strong and determined focus is on how we can improve the circumstances and opportunities for them."
201309,63,63710,225,NA,NA,It is clear that the welfare system and the subsequent culture that has become entrenched in many communities has reinforced the decline of Aboriginal communities.
201309,63,63710,226,NA,NA,"It is apparent that in pastoral areas, the 1964 wage decision that resolved equal pay for Aboriginal stockmen resulted in general unemployment for many stockmen and Aboriginal communities being displaced."
201309,63,63710,227,NA,NA,Subsequently these people have lost their purpose and connection to the land.
201309,63,63710,228,NA,NA,The injustice of unequal pay and subsequent employment discrimination has had a massive unintended consequence that will likely take generations to resolve.
201309,63,63710,229,NA,NA,KAP is committed to addressing the serious socio-economic issues facing many Aboriginal communities across Australia by working with the Elders and traditional leaders of these communities.
201309,63,63710,230,NA,NA,KAP does not support the federal intervention because the program is discriminatory and exacerbates the alienation of people who desperately need to regain a sense of self-worth and basic human dignity.
201309,63,63710,231,NA,NA,"It is undeniable that the government has an obligation to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society, but this protection must be provided respectfully and genuinely."
201309,63,63710,232,NA,NA,"KAP is concerned that Aboriginal people apparently “own” over twenty percent of Australian lands, but still do not enjoy the same title of this land as other Australians."
201309,63,63710,233,NA,NA,It is essential that all Aboriginal lands are able to be held under individual or collective title deeds.
201309,63,63710,234,NA,NA,It is essential that Aboriginal people have the opportunity and incentive to operate their land profitably and with purpose.
201309,63,63710,235,NA,NA,KAP is committed to programs of support that engage Aboriginal people constructively in the broader Australian community and economy with equality.
201309,63,63710,237,NA,NA,provide inalienable title over Aboriginal lands either collectively or individually to Aboriginal people;
201309,63,63710,238,NA,NA,end compulsory draconian and discriminatory “intervention and prohibition” laws and provide authority to community leaders to establish their own governance; |and
201309,63,63710,239,NA,NA,maintain and extend the Community Development Employment Program and engage Aboriginal people in civil construction projects including building and maintenance of housing for their own communities.
201309,63,63710,241,NA,NA,The small business sector accounts for approximately two million businesses and employs over seven million people in Australia.
201309,63,63710,242,NA,NA,The employment in small business accounts for approximately two thirds of the Australian workforce.
201309,63,63710,243,NA,NA,It is clear that the health of the small business sector is a major single determinant of the health of the economy.
201309,63,63710,244,NA,NA,Successive Australian governments have professed to be concerned about the small business sector and still the regulatory demands on the sector see it pushed nearly to the brink and the decline is seeing significant reduction in business numbers and labour utilisation in spite of population growth.
201309,63,63710,245,NA,NA,"Furthermore, the definition of a small business varies between the Australian Tax Office, Fair Work Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry."
201309,63,63710,246,NA,NA,It is exceedingly unlikely that any Australian government has made any serious commitment to the small business sector when they have not even taken the time to define the sector.
201309,63,63710,247,NA,NA,"Interestingly, not a single one of the many Australian definitions of the small business sector correlates with our major international competitors."
201309,63,63710,248,NA,NA,Australian government definitions range from:
201309,63,63710,249,NA,NA,less than 15 employees by simple count rather than full time equivalents for Fair Work Australia;
201309,63,63710,250,NA,NA,less than 20 employees for the Australian Bureau of Statistics;
201309,63,63710,251,NA,NA,less than 50 employees for the Australian Tax Office;
201309,63,63710,252,NA,NA,less than two million dollars in revenue for the Reserve Bank of Australia; | and
201309,63,63710,253,NA,NA,less than fifty million dollars for the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority.
201309,63,63710,254,NA,NA,"Typically, small business operators actually operate the business they own or at very least have an intimate knowledge of the operation. | example:"
201309,63,63710,255,NA,NA,"Similarly, most small business operators are not often “sophisticated”, in the corporate sense, and their primary skills tend to lie in the field of the service or production sector that the business operates within. | For"
201309,63,63710,256,NA,NA,"A plumbing contractor is usually a plumber with a trade background, and is not a university trained business management graduate."
201309,63,63710,257,NA,NA,"A farmer is usually skilled in production of crops or livestock, and is not a tax accountant or industrial relations lawyer."
201309,63,63710,258,NA,NA,"As a result we see small business severely disadvantaged by government regulation and compliance, which does not differentiate between a large or small employer."
201309,63,63710,259,NA,NA,Small business operators are besieged by predatory and anti-competitive behaviour of big business.
201309,63,63710,260,NA,NA,"Similarly, small business is increasingly besieged by the regulatory systems of government which are really targeting big business and indifferently catching small business in the crossfire."
201309,63,63710,261,NA,NA,The result is that we are seeing small business survival rates decline sharply and the rate of labour utilisation by small business contract even faster.
201309,63,63710,262,NA,NA,The increasing demands on small business administration and compliance do nothing to improve productivity or profitability and simply add cost to the business and demotivate the sector.
201309,63,63710,263,NA,NA,KAP is committed to supporting small business and recognises that it is the sector of the economy most able to drive growth and innovation in the Australian economy and with meaningful support will provide the biggest growth in employment in terms of numbers of jobs and numbers of hours of work.
201309,63,63710,264,NA,NA,The Australian government has progressively pushed compliance requirements onto business in regards to the roll out of the administration of increasingly complex employee services such as tax collection and management and superannuation administration.
201309,63,63710,265,NA,NA,It is alarming that the superannuation industry is filled with highly trained accountants and administrators who do not pick up a pencil without charging someone and the government expects small business operators to perform all the accounting and compliance functions for superannuation at no cost.
201309,63,63710,266,NA,NA,The reality is that the cost of compliance and implementation of increasingly complex payroll management systems cannot be efficiently offset on small workforces that typically define small business.
201309,63,63710,267,NA,NA,KAP is committed to reducing red tape and compliance costs for small business and recognises that the marginal unit costs to compliance to small business must be considered in contrast to the marginal unit costs to big business.
201309,63,63710,268,NA,NA,KAP is committed to seeing regulatory impact assessments for small business mandated for relevant legislation and regulation.
201309,63,63710,270,NA,NA,provide a consistent definition of small business in Australia that ensures competitive advantage for Australian small business (less than 50 employee threshold preferred);
201309,63,63710,271,NA,NA,give small business the same rights under competition policy as consumers;
201309,63,63710,272,NA,NA,give small business the same rights under industrial relations law as employees;
201309,63,63710,273,NA,NA,mandate regulatory impact assessments specifically for small business;
201309,63,63710,274,NA,NA,establish a Small Business Ombudsmen with particular interest in predatory anti-competitive behaviour by big business and compliance cost burdens; | and
201309,63,63710,275,NA,NA,"provide separate award conditions for small business that recognise the difference between big business and small business,"
201309,63,63710,276,NA,NA,while still providing certainty to employees.
201309,63,63710,278,NA,NA,"Australia should be a world leader and innovator in the field of education; but our ranks are slipping, as globally we become less competitive and productive."
201309,63,63710,279,NA,NA,"In order to provide future generations with the best possible opportunities, we must provide them with the best possible foundation – an education which is second to none!"
201309,63,63710,280,NA,NA,"KAP education reforms will ensure that all Australians, regardless of their circumstance, will receive a world class education; that means that not only will these reforms ensure that regardless of the school or State of enrolment, that students will receive the same benefits from the education system, but this also means, that the education system must rival any other education system in the world."
201309,63,63710,281,NA,NA,"Australia must aim to close the education gap, internally, within Australia, and externally, with other countries. KAP recognises the necessary reforms required for our education system nationally."
201309,63,63710,282,NA,NA,"However, the focus of such reforms should not only focus on budgetary and monetary constraints."
201309,63,63710,283,NA,NA,What is required is a significant overhaul of the current model used to teach Australia’s children.
201309,63,63710,284,NA,NA,"It is obvious that the greatest impact is upon students and young Australians, who due to a failing system, are not given every possible opportunity, which should be available to them."
201309,63,63710,285,NA,NA,"Ultimately, Australia as a Nation will suffer, unless there is immediate reform to the education system."
201309,63,63710,286,NA,NA,"In today’s world, a proper education is not an option, but rather it is a necessity."
201309,63,63710,287,NA,NA,"With technological advancements, and an interconnected global economy, Australia must advance to compete."
201309,63,63710,288,NA,NA,"As a country, Australia is facing immediate challenges in terms of productivity and efficiency, the best way to resolve this, is with a better educated, more productive and more efficient workforce; this will only occur with a significantly improved education system."
201309,63,63710,289,NA,NA,"Furthermore, teachers, principals and those working to provide our future generations with the best possible opportunities are underpaid, under-appreciated and overworked."
201309,63,63710,290,NA,NA,"KAP seeks to recognise the contributions of these people, and ensure that the educators throughout Australia are given the appreciation and reward that they deserve."
201309,63,63710,292,NA,NA,The 2011 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) provides some very sobering statistics as to where Australia stands internationally with respect to education.
201309,63,63710,294,NA,NA,"In reading skills, Australia is ranked 27th out of 45, and"
201309,63,63710,295,NA,NA,"In mathematics, 18th out of 45, and"
201309,63,63710,296,NA,NA,"In science, 25th out of 45."
201309,63,63710,297,NA,NA,"Furthermore, 24% of year four students did not meet the “intermediate benchmark” for the study, regarded as the minimal acceptable standard of literacy."
201309,63,63710,298,NA,NA,"Perhaps even more troubling, of the teachers surveyed in conjunction with the study, in year four classrooms, only 75% of students were being taught by teachers who considered themselves “very confident” in the subject matter they were teaching."
201309,63,63710,299,NA,NA,"The studies show that by high school, Australia improves in the rankings, but is certainly not the front runner in education."
201309,63,63710,301,NA,NA,"KAP proposes to better utilise the existing funding, more efficiently and productively."
201309,63,63710,302,NA,NA,"As with any organisation seeking structural change, the national education system must reallocate existing funding to facilitate better performance, and seek internal efficacy."
201309,63,63710,303,NA,NA,"KAP proposes a more grassroots approach to education; removing the current hierarchal and bureaucratic structure will provide greater control to principals and teachers, dramatically reducing costs, and allowing for the reallocation of funds to where they are most needed; the schools, principals and teachers, and most importantly, the students."
201309,63,63710,304,NA,NA,"Primarily, the focus should be on providing a solid foundation of reading, writing and mathematics."
201309,63,63710,305,NA,NA,"This is required, as each stage of education should be considered as a building block, or stepping stone to the next, regardless of what that stage may be."
201309,63,63710,306,NA,NA,The foremost reform that KAP will introduce will be to develop the single most influential determinant to great teaching – the teachers.
201309,63,63710,307,NA,NA,"Throughout Australia, KAP wants to recruit, promote, reward and most of all, celebrate, great teachers."
201309,63,63710,308,NA,NA,"Undoubtedly, the key to the future success of Australia’s education system is great teaching."
201309,63,63710,309,NA,NA,"KAP proposes that in order to provide a better education to young Australians, we must identify great teaching – and reward it! In order to provide better outcomes from the education system, we must improve the quality and efficacy of teaching."
201309,63,63710,310,NA,NA,The single most important variable in determining the success of any student is the effectiveness of the teacher.
201309,63,63710,311,NA,NA,"The reason KAP is focussing on the teachers, is that we realise that they are the solution to the education problem; the problem is the system in which they are forced to work."
201309,63,63710,312,NA,NA,"The question then becomes how do we measure student effectiveness? Through student growth; that being, it does not matter the standard of the student at the beginning of the school year, only that they have improved under the guidance of their teacher, and are able to do so year after year."
201309,63,63710,313,NA,NA,KAP wants to work closely with teachers who are passionate about developing standards and metrics which will allow for a useful and practical evaluation for ensuring student growth.
201309,63,63710,314,NA,NA,"Upon implementation of such standards and metrics teacher remuneration would be directly linked by providing teachers with a base salary, with additional bonuses paid in accordance with demonstrated student growth."
201309,63,63810,2,NA,NA,The federal government must assure the defence and security of this nation and its people
201309,63,63810,3,NA,NA,"This core responsibility of government is one where Australians rightly expect that what needs to be done will be done, and that appropriate funding will be available."
201309,63,63810,4,NA,NA,"Australia’s defence force, customs and quarantine protection require strategic forward-planning to keep pace with emerging trends and new threats"
201309,63,63810,5,NA,NA,They also need rigorous and prudent ﬁnancial management.
201309,63,63810,6,NA,NA,Our defence forces must maintain combat readiness and our serving men and women must be equipped with state-of-the-art technology and logistical support
201309,63,63810,7,NA,NA,"Their goals must be realistic, enhance our defence capabilities and be geared to tangible results in our national interest."
201309,63,63810,8,NA,NA,"For example, the effective location of defence facilities across regional Australia is vital to any comprehensive defence strategy, both for the nation and for its regional development"
201309,63,63810,9,NA,NA,"The timely deployment of personnel and resources to military hot spots – globally, in our region and domestically – also requires a signiﬁcant presence in regional Australia."
201309,63,63810,10,NA,NA,"The Nationals, therefore, support the retention of existing defence facilities in regional areas"
201309,63,63810,11,NA,NA,"In fact, to better serve Australia’s defence interests, we will move to identify those defence facilities currently in major population centres that can be decentralised, and to house as many personnel as possible in regional areas of Australia."
201309,63,63810,12,NA,NA,Protecting our borders extends beyond military considerations
201309,63,63810,13,NA,NA,Regional Australians know that our singular pest and disease-free status is crucial to the productive capacity and marketing of our food and ﬁbre domestic and export industries.
201309,63,63810,14,NA,NA,Labor’s disgraceful abandonment of sound science-based quarantine and biosecurity safeguards and reduced resourcing is alarming
201309,63,63810,15,1,-1,"This neglect is reﬂected in Labor’s approach to securing our borders against illicit drugs, illegal ﬁshing crews and people smuggling."
201309,63,63810,18,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ defence force strategy combines several initiatives to provide our military and allied personnel with the equipment and support necessary for a strong, cohesive and well-coordinated military."
201309,63,63810,19,NA,NA,"We will ensure that Australia’s defence procurement program targets sufﬁcient resources to modernise military equipment, in consultation with serving personnel and other expert input."
201309,63,63810,20,NA,NA,"Resources will be directed to the appropriate maintenance of existing equipment, and the decommissioning of equipment and facilities which have reached their use-by date"

201309,63,63810,22,NA,NA,"Training facilities, including the Australian Defence Force Academy and the Royal Military College Duntroon, will be given high priority in the defence budget."
201309,63,63810,23,NA,NA,Once-and-for-all we will provide ﬁtting recognition of the service of our military and their families
201309,63,63810,24,NA,NA,"With Australian forces deployed in many active theatres, support services for the injured and those who may not return at all must match the sentiments of a grateful nation"

201309,63,63810,219,NA,NA,We will seek a federal-state agreement on funding speech therapists in all schools to ensure learning difﬁculties are detected and addressed early in a child’s education; and to consider the opportunities to address occupational therapy as well.
201309,63,63810,221,NA,NA,"Attracting and retaining skilled educators in regional Australia is a perennial problem, one exacerbated by the states offering different pay rates to entice teachers to switch between states."
201309,63,63810,222,NA,NA,"The Nationals support the development of a standardised national system of incentive payments that encourages qualiﬁed teachers to relocate to, or remain in, rural and regional locations."
201309,63,63810,223,NA,NA,Teacher shortages are a signiﬁcant issue
201309,63,63810,224,NA,NA,"Factors contributing include isolation from other schools, lack of professional support, lack of coaching mentors, insufﬁcient access to quality learning, lack of housing and lack of local services."
201309,63,63810,225,NA,NA,Regional teachers need support to ensure equity is provided and The Nationals will seek to implement a Teacher Relocation Incentive Scheme to address these problems.
201309,63,63810,226,NA,NA,"A Regional Teacher Network will be established to provide the linkage between teachers and communities in regional areas, designed to ensure teacher relocation is hassle free."
201309,63,63810,227,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ initiative of Rural Teaching Schools is designed to address the lack of skilled educators in the regions and, via a fouryear pilot program, could lead to the creation of a federal government fund to establish permanent Rural Teaching Schools."
201309,63,63810,228,NA,NA,"In addition, we support bonded scholarships for regional students to study in areas of skills shortage at university – with the proviso that, at the completion of their studies, they agree to return to an area of need for a ﬁxed period of three years."
201309,63,63810,230,NA,NA,"Regional universities, and the regional campuses of city universities, play a valuable part in improving access to education for students in the regions"
201309,63,63810,231,NA,NA,The Nationals support policies that encourage and support the universities to deliver services in regional communities.
201309,63,63810,232,NA,NA,The experience of attending university is much more than sitting in a lecture theatre
201309,63,63810,233,NA,NA,"University councils should have the power to include, in setting their fees, an amount to cover a limited range of student services, particularly the sporting and recreational facilities that enhance the university experience."
201309,63,63810,234,NA,NA,"The Nationals will provide ﬁnancial resources through a Faculty of Excellence Program for regional universities, to allow them to focus on particular areas of excellence to enhance the university’s reputation"
201309,63,63810,235,NA,NA,"In government, as part of our health policy, we will support the establishment of a new Murray Darling Medical School and invite proposals from other regionally based universities to establish rural medical schools in areas of rural need and shortage"
201309,63,63810,236,NA,NA,"To ensure better accountability and transparency, we will support naming those universities which do not meet the target of 25% of medical students from a rural background, and subsequently advise the sanctions applied in those cases."
201309,63,63810,237,NA,NA,"The Nationals will introduce initiatives to assist Australian agriculture and mining schools, as well as universities, to obtain the resources and scientiﬁc and professional research skills they need."
201309,63,63810,238,NA,NA,"We will facilitate collaboration between universities and industry, particularly in the area of agriculture and agribusiness, to ensure a sustainable workforce into the future"
201309,63,63810,239,NA,NA,The Nationals will also work to establish an Agricultural Research Fund to ensure university research in this area is properly recognised and supported.
201309,63,63810,241,NA,NA,The Nationals also believe that a quality education is not dependent on attending university
201309,63,63810,242,NA,NA,"Many regional students prefer vocational training and apprenticeships, and regional Australia needs skilled trades people."
201309,63,63810,243,NA,NA,"We will provide the ﬁnancial incentives for young people to take up traineeships in the agricultural sector, on the same footing as other traineeships and apprenticeships, and will place tertiary-level agriculture and forestry courses in the National Priorities Category of the Students Contribution Band."
201309,63,63810,244,NA,NA,"The Nationals will provide incentives for regional employers to give students work experience and gap year employment, to foster local career and job opportunities."
201309,63,63810,245,NA,NA,The waste of up to $5 billion on Labor’s school hall program could have paid for hundreds of thousands of apprenticeships
201309,63,63810,246,NA,NA,The Nationals will ensure that vocational training receives the attention it deserves to ensure that regional Australia gets the skilled workers it needs.
201309,63,63810,247,NA,NA,We will examine the feasibility of applying Adult Learning Australia policy to every Australian town with a population of more than 200 and is more than 80km from a TAFE or University campus.
201309,63,63810,248,NA,NA,The Community Learning Centre can operate as an access point for Higher Education and TAFE and for locals.
201309,63,63810,250,NA,NA,"The Nationals recognise how difﬁcult it can be for families with children with special needs to access education in regional areas, and will provide adequate resources for schools to provide support for these children."
201309,63,63810,251,NA,NA,"We support a funding model that ties assistance for these students to the student; that is, when students relocate, the funding transfers with them."
201309,63,63810,252,NA,NA,"The Nationals also support a funding model that treats students with special needs in non-government schools equally, and on the same basis, with children attending government schools."
201309,63,63810,253,NA,NA,We support measures to harmonise the treatment of these students across state borders to ensure their families are well supported in seeking the best possible educational outcomes for these children.
201309,63,63810,255,NA,NA,"Bonded scholarships have been introduced for medical students to attract new doctors to regional areas, and these schemes have produced positive results."
201309,63,63810,256,NA,NA,The Nationals will seek to introduce a scheme to refund the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) fees of graduates who work in regional areas of need and contribute to the economic development and social fabric of regional Australia.
201309,63,63810,257,NA,NA,"We also support a review of HECS-HELP debt indexing and in relation to amount to be paid per annum, the possible application of a cap of 2% of the repayment income as determined by the Australian Tax Ofﬁce."
201309,63,63810,259,NA,NA,We will work to reverse the Department of Veterans’ Affairs decision not to fund costs incurred by ex-service organisation volunteers attending training and information programs.
201309,63,63810,261,NA,NA,"The Nationals take a practical approach to environmental policy, insisting on a balance between economic, social and environmental considerations."
201309,63,63810,262,NA,NA,"It is too often ignored that regional Australians live, work and are heavily invested in the natural environment around them"
201309,63,63810,263,NA,NA,Their lifestyle and the vibrancies of their local communities are intrinsically linked to the health and wellbeing of natural resources and sound environmental management.
201309,63,63810,264,NA,NA,It is common sense
201309,63,63810,265,NA,NA,"For example, we recognise that our farmers are, in fact, Australia’s frontline environmentalists"
201309,63,63810,266,NA,NA,"They occupy some 60% of Australia’s landmass and, as such, many of the environmental icons, ecological communities and endangered species we want to preserve as a broader community, are literally in farmers’ backyards."
201309,63,63810,267,NA,NA,"The Nationals are focused on improving air quality, the sustainability of land, efﬁcient water-use, protection of our unique ﬂora and fauna, and preservation of the marine environment"
201309,63,63810,268,NA,NA,Getting these right will ensure the prosperity and quality of life for future generations.
201309,63,63810,269,NA,NA,"A key ingredient is workable partnerships between all levels of government, researchers and natural resource managers."
201309,63,63810,270,NA,NA,"We know that there is much to learn from those who work our land, water and ocean resources."
201309,63,63810,271,NA,NA,"Today’s food and ﬁbre producers know that the environment in which they operate is different from that faced by their grandparents, and will be different again for their grandchildren"
201309,63,63810,272,NA,NA,"They also know that knowledge is never complete, so there is always a need for continuous improvement and learning."
201309,63,63810,273,NA,NA,Successful environmental policy involves integrating responsible environmental management in all policy decisions
201309,63,63810,274,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ approach to protection of the environment takes account of human and natural activities on our eco systems, quality of life and resource management."
201309,63,63810,275,NA,NA,"We will not distort international trade or divert new investment to greenhouse emissions havens, but will encourage an orderly transition of the power generating industry to low emissions and carbon abatement and storage technology."
201309,63,63810,276,NA,NA,"We support studies into the use of alternative based power generation systems, including nuclear energy"
201309,63,63810,277,NA,NA,"We will support practical land and water management, and encourage technologies, such as biofuels, that assist to help maintain clean air."
201309,63,63810,278,NA,NA,"We will provide protection for our unique ﬂora and fauna and our oceans, while maintaining access for productive use"
201309,63,63810,279,NA,NA,"In government we will require that regular audits be conducted on the population of ﬂora and fauna considered endangered, so that updated ﬁgures of the increase or decrease in numbers can be used to make balanced decisions to be made on changes in protection measures."
201309,63,63810,280,NA,NA,"The Nationals support the licensing of breeders of endangered native fauna, with a view to enhancing the protection of these species."
201309,63,63810,281,NA,NA,"We will repeal Labor’s carbon tax, which is having a detrimental impact on the lives of regional Australians and will achieve no effective environmental outcomes."
201309,63,63810,283,NA,NA,The Nationals recognise that climate change is an urgent environmental priority and that a robust and realistic policy response is essential
201309,63,63810,284,NA,NA,"However, climate change can only be successfully addressed in the overall context of environmental, economic and social good."
201309,63,63810,285,NA,NA,"Those policies should be incentive-driven, not punitive."
201309,63,63810,287,NA,NA,The Nationals support effective global programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to insure against the risk of climate change
201309,63,63810,288,NA,NA,Wealthy industrialised countries like Australia must take a commensurate role in conjunction with the rest of the world in implementing a global response if we expect developing countries to contribute to the solution.
201309,63,63810,289,NA,NA,"Therefore, we support an Australian objective of a 5% reduction in emissions below Year 2000 levels by 2020, with larger reductions dependent on a strong international agreement being reached"
201309,63,63810,290,NA,NA,This means that Australia would reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases from 552.7 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2000 to 525 million tonnes in 2020
201309,63,63810,291,NA,NA,"The Nationals will ensure that this target is achieved without economic harm or loss of jobs, and by measures that themselves directly beneﬁt Australia."
201309,63,63810,292,NA,NA,"The Nationals are preoccupied with our communities and workable solutions, not with mindless symbolism."
201309,63,63810,293,NA,NA,"A carbon tax that weakens the Australian economy, drives up costs, creates unemployment and, ultimately, sees demand shift from Australia to higher polluting countries helps no-one"
201309,63,63810,294,NA,NA,"Worse than no climate impact, this would see a higher global carbon footprint while Australian businesses and families suffer."
201309,63,63810,295,NA,NA,Australia must play its part in addressing climate change issues
201309,63,63810,296,NA,NA,The necessary environmental outcomes can be achieved without buying and selling carbon credits and without a carbon tax.
201309,63,63810,298,NA,NA,"Continuing to develop and use practical CO2 emissions reduction measures, such as soil carbon sequestration, the revegetation of marginal land, bio-char, clean coal technology, carbon capture and the use of algae;"
201309,63,63810,299,NA,NA,"Opening a voluntary carbon market to encourage the immediate recognition and involvement of individuals and communities, agriculture and business in sequestration, with bankable offsets;"
201309,63,63810,300,NA,NA,"Energy-saving initiatives in households, industry and transport to reduce emissions;"
201309,63,63810,301,NA,NA,Incentives that spur demand for more energy-efﬁcient vehicles and the widespread use of alternative fuels;
201309,63,63810,302,NA,NA,Governments engaging the commercial building sector in improving the energy efﬁciency of city buildings and residential housing;
201309,63,63810,303,NA,NA,"Incentives that provide for the innovative use of renewable energy, without forcing large increases in energy prices; and"
201309,63,63810,304,NA,NA,The cost and allocation of renewable energy certiﬁcates to be borne by the direct beneﬁciaries.
201309,63,63810,305,NA,NA,"These measures have the potential to deliver greater reductions in emissions than Labor’s carbon tax, without the massive economic cost and job losses"
201309,63,63810,306,NA,NA,"For example, Professor Ross Garnaut estimated that land restoration works on degraded arid and semi-arid rangelands could by themselves reduce Australian annual emissions by 250 million tonnes of CO2 – easily meeting the target of 5% reduction in emissions at 2000 levels by 2020"
201309,63,63810,307,NA,NA,This would also provide a signiﬁcant increase in farm income for many land managers.
201309,63,63810,308,NA,NA,Upgrading the truck ﬂeet
201309,63,63810,309,NA,NA,We will provide incentives to upgrade the Australian truck ﬂeet to meet improved emission standards.
201309,63,63810,310,NA,NA,We aim to minimise the cost for pre-1995 truck owners and operators to encourage them to switch to more environmentally-friendly trucks.
201309,63,63810,312,NA,NA,The Nationals recognise the importance of our natural resources and understand that local communities and individual property owners are often best placed to protect the natural environment
201309,63,63810,313,NA,NA,We will directly support catchment management and Landcare organisations
201309,63,63810,314,NA,NA,"We will reinstate the funding lost by land and water management groups, such as Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs), due to poor policy decisions by Labor in government."
201309,63,63810,315,NA,NA,"The current system is clearly ﬂawed, with the government demanding that CMAs apply national priorities to local projects, even where there is clearly no correlation."
201309,63,63810,316,NA,NA,We will work with local CMAs to determine the best outcomes and encourage local groups to determine their own projects within catchment plans
201309,63,63810,317,NA,NA,We will implement long-term funding based on local plans.
201309,63,63810,318,NA,NA,"Given that we understand the importance of Landcare groups to local communities and value the 4,000 Landcare groups in Australia, we will reinstate support for the Landcare groups"
201309,63,63810,319,NA,NA,We will the restore funding cut by the Labor Government.
201309,63,63810,320,NA,NA,Almost 40% of farmers were previously involved in Landcare organisations
201309,63,63810,321,NA,NA,We will also restore funding to the 56 Natural Resource Management regions to 2007 levels.
201309,63,63810,322,NA,NA,We support the adoption by landholders of a voluntary national land management certiﬁcation system to improve environmental and native animal welfare outcomes.
201309,63,63810,323,NA,NA,"The Nationals will invest in re-plumbing regional Australia, working with farmers and local communities to invest in long-term water-saving infrastructure"
201309,63,63810,324,NA,NA,"We will review legislation so that environmental, socioeconomic and resource management considerations are all taken into account under a balanced approach."
201309,63,63810,325,NA,NA,"We support properly managed, maintained and pest controlled National Parks"
201309,63,63810,326,NA,NA,The Nationals will establish an Independent Commission through theCouncil of Australian Governments to instigate an inquiry into:
201309,63,63810,327,NA,NA,"The management and expenditure of National Park agencies and the  outcomes; • The productivity of these agencies and outcomes; and • The impact and control of pests, including feral animals, on adjoining  properties."
201309,63,63810,328,NA,NA,The Nationals in government will require that wood waste burning  from sustainably managed forests be classiﬁed as a renewable energy  resource for the purposes of power generation.
201309,63,63810,329,NA,NA,We will also address the inequities created by the listing of the  Temperate Rainforest of subtropical Australia as an endangered  ecological community.
201309,63,63810,331,NA,NA,The ever-increasing use of our oceans for commercial and recreation  activities means that greater care must be taken to ensure these  delicate ecosystems are protected.
201309,63,63810,332,NA,NA,"So that Australia can respond to threats to the marine environment  from pollution from ships, increased tourism, agricultural chemicals,  and illegal ﬁshing, The Nationals will ensure that regulatory, research  and voluntary organisations are adequately funded and co-ordinated."
201309,63,63810,333,NA,NA,This undertaking includes strengthening the role of the Marine  Environment Protection Association established by the Coalition  Government in November 1999
201309,63,63810,334,NA,NA,"The Nationals will introduce legislation to make it mandatory for ships in  Australian waters to carry a satellite transponder, so that their position is continually monitored, and accidents, such as, running aground are  averted."
201309,63,63810,336,NA,NA,Australian families are the binding threads in our social fabric
201309,63,63810,337,NA,NA,In regional Australia families assume even greater importance as social networks are fewer and people face unique challenges due to their remoteness and difﬁculty in accessing services readily available in major cities.
201309,63,63810,338,NA,NA,"While The Nationals unashamedly seek to provide support for the seven million Australians living outside major population centres, the principles of our policy apply to all Australian families."
201309,63,63810,339,NA,NA,We recognise the importance of a balance between work and family and that demography and geography in Australia mean that regional families are more reliant on support from government and community organisations.
201309,63,63810,340,NA,NA,"For many people the ideal situation of the family unit comprising two parents – with one as a fulltime carer at least until the children reach school age – children and extended family connections through grandparents, provides the best basis for a positive, stable, supported and happy family."
201309,63,63810,341,NA,NA,"However, this ideal is increasingly not possible under cost-of-living pressures, a scarcity of local employment opportunities and the rapid pace of modern life"
201309,63,63810,342,NA,NA,Families where both parents work are increasingly ‘the norm’ and many children live in an environment where their parents are apart
201309,63,63810,343,NA,NA,"Compared to major cities, children in regional Australia are less likely to be in formal childcare, instead they tend to be at home with parents or cared for under other informal arrangements."
201309,63,63810,344,NA,NA,"Because of these special circumstances confronting families in regional areas, we will provide priority resources to effective federal linkages with state, territory and local governments, as well as community groups, to ensure that families in regional Australia have the resources and support services they need."
201309,63,63810,345,NA,NA,"A lack of soft infrastructure – health and allied health services, education resources, childcare and other social institutions – provides added challenges to everyday life in regional communities, and make relocation to the regions by families less attractive."
201309,63,63810,347,NA,NA,"We consider it incumbent on the federal government to provide more than just money for programs and fund rounds for grants, but to clearly deﬁne and provide dedicated regional services to ﬁll social service gaps"
201309,63,63810,348,NA,NA,This demands a commitment to long-term planning.
201309,63,63810,350,NA,NA,"The Nationals support the introduction of paid maternity, paternity and parental leave, including for the self-employed."
201309,63,63810,351,NA,NA,We will provide more childcare places giving priority to the needs of families in regional communities.
201309,63,63810,352,NA,NA,We will reinstate funding for the ‘Take a Break’ occasional care program.
201309,63,63810,353,NA,NA,"We will support a review of childcare funding with a view to providing more ﬂexibility in the services available to smaller towns, which are discriminated against under the current model."
201309,63,63810,354,NA,NA,"The Nationals in government will immediately commission a review by the Productivity Commission of the child care system, but will in the meantime take immediate action to change any requirements preventing the delivery of child care services in regional and remote Australia, particularly those which require a qualiﬁed early childhood teacher to be employed by every long day care."
201309,63,63810,355,NA,NA,"We will also review industrial relations legislation to ensure ﬂexibility and safeguards provide a balance between work and family, thereby, providing mutual beneﬁt to employers, employees and families."
201309,63,63810,356,NA,NA,We will also eliminate employment practices that discriminate on any basis and achieve pay equality between men and women.
201309,63,63810,358,NA,NA,"The Nationals will provide support for families whose dependents have special needs, including increased funding for respite care."
201309,63,63810,359,NA,NA,"We will increase funding for services critical to maintaining the welfare of families in remote areas, in particular, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, mobile health clinics, schools of the air and support for children who have to leave home to continue their education."
201309,63,63810,360,NA,NA,"Further, we will fund reliable communication and transport infrastructure that enables reasonable access to support services, hospitals and schools to foster and maintain the wellbeing and ongoing support of families."
201309,63,63810,361,NA,NA,We will standardise and improve patient travel and accommodation assistance programs across the nation.
201309,63,63810,362,NA,NA,"The Nationals will work with the states, territories, local governments and community groups to identify and meet the needs of families with special circumstances, especially those living in remote indigenous communities, and new arrivals."
201309,63,63810,363,NA,NA,"We will increase funding for dedicated regional youth programs to seriously address chronic issues like drug and alcohol abuse, bullying and mental health."
201309,63,63810,364,NA,NA,"Moreover, we will provide increased funding to the Family Court for regional counselling services."
201309,63,63810,365,NA,NA,"As a society, we must respond positively to changing community dynamics that impact on families, including the importance of family money management and grandparents taking on the role of carers."
201309,63,63810,366,NA,NA,The Nationals support the establishment of a National Disability Insurance Scheme and will ensure that such a scheme cares for people in regional communities.
201309,63,63810,367,NA,NA,We will also provide funding to reinstate the National Community Crime Prevention Program.
201309,63,63810,369,NA,NA,"In addition to The Nationals’ Seniors plan, we recognise the role and contribution senior Australians, especially as grandparents, play in supporting modern families"
201309,63,63810,370,NA,NA,It is important for families to have the option of staying together wherever possible
201309,63,63810,371,NA,NA,"This can be particularly difﬁcult in regional areas, particularly where older parents and older grandparents are involved, and appropriate aged care facilities are often far from the family unit."
201309,63,63810,372,NA,NA,"We will provide funding, and work with all levels of government and community groups, to increase the number of dedicated aged care facilities and places in regional areas."
201309,63,63810,373,NA,NA,"In a society that is increasingly time poor, too often we fail to treasure our older citizens in the way they deserve and this does pose increased risk of social isolation with adverse consequences for the physical and mental health of older Australians."
201309,63,63810,375,NA,NA,Support community initiatives to prevent the increase in social isolation;
201309,63,63810,376,NA,NA,"Develop pilot programs that encourage government, business and community groups to commit to engaging with older Australians, where individuals and workers are encouraged to initiate and maintain contact with the lonely and isolated;"
201309,63,63810,377,NA,NA,Support training and vocational programs for the 3rd (50 to 75) and 4th (75+) age;
201309,63,63810,378,NA,NA,Support community-based mentoring programs to allow older Australians to engage with and provide a positive role model for younger people; and
201309,63,63810,379,NA,NA,"While ageism can be a community problem, The Nationals believe government has a leading role to play in helping to shift community attitudes."
201309,63,63810,381,NA,NA,Ensure that age discrimination legislation and regulatory mechanisms are enshrined and resourced in the same manner as other antidiscrimination measures; and
201309,63,63810,382,NA,NA,Review all Commonwealth legislation and act to remove any remaining provisions that treat people unfairly because of their age.

201309,63,63810,494,NA,NA,And we will go further with the advent of a dedicated Federal Minister for Regional Health to speciﬁcally oversee regional healthcare and the needs of regional patients.

201309,63,63810,520,NA,NA,"Research by Deloitte shows that 1.6 million people in the government’s target income brackets will dump their private hospital cover, with another 4.3 million downgrading it."
201309,63,63810,521,NA,NA,"This initial exodus will force premiums up an estimated 10% after the ﬁrst year of means testing, putting health insurance beyond the reach of lower income earners and causing a second exodus"
201309,63,63810,522,NA,NA,"In fact, 5.6 million Australians with private cover earn less than $50,000 a year"

201309,63,63810,529,NA,NA,"The Nationals will provide increased ﬁnancial support for doctors who provide health services in regional and remote communities, through increased Medicare rebates and scheduled fees loaded on top of regular Medicare billings, which will increase according to remoteness."
201309,63,63810,530,NA,NA,We will engage with the relevant medical colleges to determine an appropriate scheduled Medicare fee for particular services delivered in regional and remote Australia
201309,63,63810,531,NA,NA,The ﬁnancial beneﬁts of regional practice will become more apparent and accessible.
201309,63,63810,532,NA,NA,This program will include allied health workers and nurses to attract a full range of health professionals to regional areas.

201309,63,63810,559,NA,NA,We will introduce funding for aged care beds under similar arrangements for hospitals by establishing a new system where federal and state funding is pooled into a single fund for each region that is managed at the regional level.
201309,63,63810,560,NA,NA,"This way community needs can best be identiﬁed and acted upon, and locals will own the outcomes of priorities and decisions."
201309,63,63810,562,NA,NA,"The Nationals will establish a targeted regional health fund as part of our fair share commitment, providing funds for new regional health services, including incentives to attract and retain healthcare professionals in the regions."

201309,63,63810,572,NA,NA,"Many practitioners prefer to be employees, rather than managers, and to focus their attention on healthcare delivery."

201309,63,63810,579,NA,NA,"As the map allows doctors in a larger regional centre to be paid the same incentive as doctors practising in the smaller towns, we will ensure that any replacement system is based on criteria that more accurately reﬂect the medical needs of individual communities in consultation with the Rural Doctors Association of Australia."
201309,63,63810,580,NA,NA,The plethora of complex programs designed to provide incentives for doctors to take up regional practice lower their effectiveness and skew services against regional areas in favour of outer metropolitan areas.
201309,63,63810,581,NA,NA,"Since 2000, more than 30 separate programs designed to attract doctors to regional Australia have helped boost the numbers of health providers, but have had their effectiveness hindered by red tape, duplication and conﬂicting goals"

201309,63,63810,600,NA,NA,"The geographic maldistribution has resulted in chronic shortages of doctors, particularly GPs, in rural and regional areas and continued high dependence on overseas-trained doctors."
201309,63,63810,601,NA,NA,"The model of medical education where training takes place in capital cities and in large metropolitan hospitals, with only short stints of service in rural and regional areas, does not address the ongoing undersupply of rural doctors"

201309,63,63810,606,NA,NA,"This signiﬁcant development can serve as a driver to encourage further investments in regional medical schools across Australia, with a ﬂow on effect to the regions as businesses establish and grow to serve the needs of the medical schools."
201309,63,63810,608,NA,NA,"Many regions lack allied health professionals, such as dentists, nurses, optometrists, psychiatrists and other service providers."

201309,63,63810,777,NA,NA,More needs to be done to identify and encourage economic development opportunities in remote Australia
201309,63,63810,778,NA,NA,"To this end, we will consider a special taxation regime for investment in any remote community where the population is sufﬁcient to provide the workforce for any local potential business or commercial project."
201309,63,63810,779,NA,NA,This taxation arrangement would allow an accelerated depreciation schedule for capital investment
201309,63,63810,780,NA,NA,Taxation zones would not be speciﬁcally deﬁned
201309,63,63810,781,NA,NA,"Nor would accelerated depreciation concessions be automatically available, but would be granted subject to application and on an individual project basis, to encourage private sector investment and economic development."

201309,63,63810,784,NA,NA,"Productivity gains, driven by research and development, have enabled Australian producers to stay ahead of our international competitors"
201309,63,63810,785,NA,NA,"For example, over the 30 years from 1974 to 2004, Australian farms consistently achieved leading average multifactor productivity growth of 2.8% per year."
201309,63,63810,786,NA,NA,Maintaining that competitive edge is a constant battle and getting harder
201309,63,63810,787,NA,NA,"In fact, Australian is losing its edge"
201309,63,63810,788,NA,NA,The alarming decline in agricultural research and development sees Australia being outstripped dollar-for-dollar by many developing countries.
201309,63,63810,789,NA,NA,"Meanwhile, federal Labor’s cuts to agricultural research spending, eliminating the majority of Cooperative Research Centres and the abolition of Land and Water Australia, have been extremely shortsighted."
201309,63,63810,790,NA,NA,"Over the same period, Labor provided research and development funds for agriculture in other countries to the tune of $464 million – an investment that could have been injected into innovation in Australian food production, driving productivity gains here before sharing our intellectual property with others"
201309,63,63810,791,NA,NA,"In Australia, on current funding levels, and without a resolute vision, the days of cutting-edge farm production are numbered, and a declining trend in productivity growth in many parts of agricultural activity is now becoming common."
201309,63,63810,792,NA,NA,"Research is not just a line item being cut in the Federal Budget, it represents the future"
201309,63,63810,793,NA,NA,Evidence and experience shows that it takes 30 to 40 years to bring embryonic research ideas to a point where 95% of the country adopts and applies that research.
201309,63,63810,794,NA,NA,"Eroding funding for agricultural research and development reduces Australia’s capability to contribute to global food production, reduces Australia’s national science capacity, and exacerbates the global food security problems of tomorrow."
201309,63,63810,795,NA,NA,"Australia is one of the world’s most important food and ﬁbre producing nations, and we can still increase our productivity signiﬁcantly – as long as we have the right policy framework."
201309,63,63810,796,NA,NA,"The Nationals assert that Australians must be more than self-sufﬁcient in food, we have the capacity to make a valuable contribution to feeding the world’s rapidly expanding population."
201309,63,63810,797,NA,NA,Population pressure is placing increasing demands on global food and ﬁbre and production
201309,63,63810,798,NA,NA,"Many traditional food and ﬁbre producing nations face urban spread, desertiﬁcation and declining water resources, resulting in less land available for food and ﬁbre production"
201309,63,63810,799,NA,NA,Food and water security are already the deﬁning issues of the 21st century
201309,63,63810,800,NA,NA,Food producers are coming under enormous pressure to increase productivity while using fewer natural resources.
201309,63,63810,801,NA,NA,Feeding our nation and fulﬁlling our trade obligations are fundamental government priorities
201309,63,63810,802,NA,NA,The Nationals are committed to a new policy direction for the nation in primary production.
201309,63,63810,804,NA,NA,"In a world under growing population pressure and facing a changing climate, our primary producers are more important than ever to the nation’s survival, opportunities and prosperity."
201309,63,63810,805,NA,NA,Food and ﬁbre production and water availability are key drivers in shaping international policy for this century
201309,63,63810,806,NA,NA,The Nationals’ practical approach to primary production needs will position Australia as an increasingly important player in the world economy.
201309,63,63810,808,NA,NA,"People in regional Australia often speak of the increasing ‘disconnect’ between the realities, challenges and rewards of primary production and the perception held by urban dwellers of regional life."
201309,63,63810,809,NA,NA,"This lack of understanding in the cities, where policies are developed, results in unrealistic policies, particularly on environmental matters, which are then imposed on primary producers."
201309,63,63810,810,NA,NA,The Nationals maintain that the vital role primary producers play in the economic and social fabric of the nation should be formally recognised in a major government policy statement
201309,63,63810,811,NA,NA,"We will audit all environmental legislation at local, state and federal level, determining what may be best undertaken by the states and territories, to streamline regulations and removing unworkable ‘green tape’ so that food production can be expanded, where appropriate."
201309,63,63810,812,NA,NA,"Australians also need to be better informed about the basic costs of producing food and ﬁbre, especially the factors inﬂuencing prices, and the very real beneﬁts to consumers of choosing Australian produce."
201309,63,63810,813,NA,NA,We will implement clear ‘truth in labelling laws’ to help buyers make informed purchasing decisions and we will support the Australian food industry in its endeavours to create more innovative and healthier products for consumers.
201309,63,63810,814,NA,NA,"In particular, the industry must be allowed to continue to improve its product without being unfairly hindered by inappropriate labelling laws and ‘health trafﬁc light’ warnings on labelling that confuse and misinform the public."
201309,63,63810,815,NA,NA,"We will continue to support regional forestry agreements, as providing resource security, best practice land-use, and sustainability."
201309,63,63810,817,NA,NA,"Foreign investment in Australian agriculture has been, and will remain, vital for growth, capital, innovation and the development of new agricultural regions."
201309,63,63810,818,NA,NA,"Yet, too much foreign control over production and supply chains could have dramatic impacts on resources, markets, supply and, ultimately, prices"
201309,63,63810,819,NA,NA,This price effect could be two-fold: downstream to what farmers are paid and upstream to what consumers pay.
201309,63,63810,820,NA,NA,Only Queensland keeps a register of foreign land acquisitions
201309,63,63810,821,2,0,These records show that the area of Queensland owned by foreigners actually declined slightly for most of the past decade.
201309,63,63810,822,NA,NA,"But over the two ﬁnancial years to July 2010, the land owned by foreign  interests tripled to 4.45 million hectares – about 2.6% of the area of the  state"
201309,63,63810,823,NA,NA,"Interests in the UK own half of that land, with the US, Germany,  Holland and Switzerland making up the top ﬁve."
201309,63,63810,824,NA,NA,"Singapore, Malaysia, China and Korea topped the list in terms of value over 2009-2011, suggesting they are active in the premium city property market."
201309,63,63810,825,NA,NA,Foreign takeovers of Australian agribusiness have increased 10-fold since the election of the Rudd/Gillard Government
201309,63,63810,826,NA,NA,"Grains, meat, sugar, dairy, dried fruits, wine, food processing and farm supplies have all seen major recent acquisitions."
201309,63,63810,827,NA,NA,The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ small voluntary sample suggests the amount of farmland in foreign hands in Australia has only risen by 0.1% over the past 30 years – from 5.9% to 6.0%.
201309,63,63810,828,NA,NA,People are understandably concerned by the lack of reliable data to guide sensible policies
201309,63,63810,829,NA,NA,It also means the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) is not fully informed.
201309,63,63810,830,NA,NA,"The Lowy Institute’s 2012 survey shows the depth of feeling in the community about foreign ownership of Australian farmland, with 81% of people opposed and 63% of those vehemently opposed."
201309,63,63810,831,NA,NA,The Nationals have led the way this issue
201309,63,63810,832,NA,NA,"We are not anti-foreign investment, but people are entitled to know what is going on, and who owns what, in their backyard"
201309,63,63810,833,NA,NA,"Over 2011-12 Nationals leader the Hon Warren Truss chaired the Coalition’s foreign investment taskforce, culminating in the policy discussion paper, Foreign Investment in Australian Agricultural Land and Agribusiness."
201309,63,63810,834,NA,NA,"The paper argues that foreign ownership should be more transparent, proposing that more purchases be scrutinised by the FIRB to ensure they are in the national interest."
201309,63,63810,835,NA,NA,A national register of foreign acquisitions should be established so that all Australians have access to accurate information on what land and agribusinesses are owned by foreign interests.
201309,63,63810,836,NA,NA,Lowering the threshold for FIRB assessment of proposed farm and agribusiness purchases would ensure that more acquisitions are subjected to the national interest test.
201309,63,63810,837,NA,NA,"In the case of farm purchases, the trigger for scrutiny would be reduced from the current $244 million threshold to $15 million"
201309,63,63810,838,NA,NA,"Importantly, we propose to also capture creeping acquisitions"
201309,63,63810,839,NA,NA,"Those buying multiple farms that add up to $15 million, even over many years, would be subjected to the national interest test."
201309,63,63810,840,NA,NA,"For agribusiness, the trigger would apply where the investment represents 15% in an agribusiness valued at $244 million, or exceeds $53 million, whichever is the smaller sum."
201309,63,63810,841,NA,NA,All proposed acquisitions by sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises would continue to automatically attract the national interest test.
201309,63,63810,842,NA,NA,By lowering these thresholds we can be sure that the national interest test is applied to purchases that currently go through to the keeper
201309,63,63810,843,NA,NA,"We also propose a broader skills-set on the FIRB, including agricultural expertise, and increasing its size to seven members"
201309,63,63810,844,NA,NA,This would enhance the board’s knowledge-base and ability to make informed assessments of the national interest in relation to farm and agribusiness acquisitions.
201309,63,63810,845,NA,NA,Having better checks and balances in place does not threaten foreign investment in agriculture
201309,63,63810,846,NA,NA,"In fact, there are more onerous provisions in place for suburban real estate, commercial property and media ownership, to cite a few."
201309,63,63810,847,NA,NA,But it does give us more information and greater transparency to ensure Australia’s national interests are protected and to identify those times when issues of concern must be addressed.

201309,63,63810,853,NA,NA,"State Labor governments, especially in Queensland and New South Wales sold-off mining and exploration rights and have granted land use priority over agriculture."
201309,63,63810,854,NA,NA,"In the case of forestry, the taxation incentives formerly provided through managed investment schemes gave forestry (and some horticulture schemes) an unfair tax advantage and distorted investment and markets"
201309,63,63810,855,NA,NA,"Forestry now occupies 0.4% of Australia’s farmland, but this could rise to 6.2% by 2020 under the Labor-Greens-Independents’ carbon tax regime, which skews land use."
201309,63,63810,856,NA,NA,"These conﬂicts create risks for Australia’s long term food security, water management, social and physical environment, and threaten our biodiversity"
201309,63,63810,857,NA,NA,"Unless addressed now, these pressures will escalate to unmanageable levels."
201309,63,63810,858,NA,NA,"While land-use is predominantly (and constitutionally) a matter for the states, The Nationals insist that there is a federal responsibility to develop national solutions in consultation with the states and territories that deal fairly with all parties."

201309,63,63810,908,NA,NA,We will review the Australian Plague Locust Commission to ensure that its funding and governance are adequate to deal with emerging threats.
201309,63,63810,910,NA,NA,"In addition to the challenges described under our Food Security plan, Australia’s primary producers confront many challenges, including climate variability; local and exotic pests, weeds and diseases; increasing consumer demand for fresher, tastier, more sustainable and cheaper food; and increasingly expensive inputs, such as water, fuel, fertilisers, chemicals, labour and energy."
201309,63,63810,911,NA,NA,"The Nationals recognise the importance of research on climate variability, founded on scientiﬁc merit"
201309,63,63810,912,NA,NA,"We will focus on those research projects with the potential to revolutionise agriculture, ﬁsheries or forestry production."
201309,63,63810,913,NA,NA,"For example, we will accelerate research into perennial cereal crops, particularly wheat, which are disease resistant, high yielding, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, are water efﬁcient, drought resistant, and can produce high protein grain."
201309,63,63810,914,NA,NA,"Further, we will support the efforts of the Australian Wool Industry and others in establishing an orderly phasing out of surgical mulesing and the development of a viable alternative practice for the prevention of breech strike in sheep"

201309,63,63810,918,NA,NA,Primary production is one of the very few sectors where commodity groups contribute signiﬁcant resources through transactional levies towards research and development for their sector.

201309,63,63810,927,NA,NA,We will undertake a science-based review of marine park declarations to ensure decisions over ﬁsheries and the environment take heed of social and economic impacts.
201309,63,63810,928,NA,NA,"Under Labor, community consultation has been a sham, science has taken a backseat to ‘feel good’ declarations and there has been a complete about-face on the commitment to minimise socio-economic fallout for commercial and recreational ﬁshers and regional communities."
201309,63,63810,929,NA,NA,"The Nationals support a science-based review of Labor’s arbitrary marine park declarations and, in place of Green dogma, will restore common sense by making a balanced account of the economic, social and environmental considerations in the process."

201309,63,63810,943,NA,NA,d) supporting the creation of a supermarket code of conduct applying to supermarkets and their purchase of dairy and egg products.
201309,63,63810,945,NA,NA,"Too often taken for granted, the regions beyond Australia’s major population centres remain the economic engine room of this country, generating the lion’s share of our exports."

201309,63,63810,949,NA,NA,But it’s more than just a fair share principle
201309,63,63810,950,NA,NA,This new investment must be more than funding programs or bricks and mortar – it must also focus on building human capital in our regions.
201309,63,63810,951,NA,NA,"As a nation, we are overdue in recognising the role regional areas can, and must, play in overcoming Australia’s national challenges."

201309,63,63810,954,NA,NA,"Our regions cry out for more people, services, infrastructure, businesses and employees."
201309,63,63810,955,NA,NA,It’s time to correct that imbalance.
201309,63,63810,956,NA,NA,We need to seriously address this population squeeze and pull the policy levers that can reenergize and build the under-developed 97% of Australia that is regional
201309,63,63810,957,NA,NA,That’s where the real untapped growth potential lies.
201309,63,63810,958,NA,NA,"We need a tonic for Australia’s city population ills – a proactive solution to our congested cities, bursting under a national population of just 22 million people."
201309,63,63810,959,NA,NA,"Unless we, as a nation, can bring businesses and people to major regional cities and develop new commercial centres, 36 million people by 2050 will grind our cities into perpetual gridlock."

201309,63,63810,978,NA,NA,We understand that regional development institutions must be properly resourced and then given the freedom to make their own decisions.
201309,63,63810,980,NA,NA,"Regional communities face problems neither they, nor government, can directly control"
201309,63,63810,981,NA,NA,"Some are seasonal, such as drought or ﬂood; some are ongoing structural challenges such as the ageing of the nonmetropolitan population and the loss of young people to the major cities; some are external, such as unstable or corrupt international markets."
201309,63,63810,982,NA,NA,"Many regions outside capital cities have a relatively narrow economic base and lack the scale and resilience of cities, making them open to sudden economic shocks, and the gradual erosion of their skills base."
201309,63,63810,983,NA,NA,"The Nationals support regions in addressing those problems they can directly inﬂuence, and in limiting the adverse effects of others beyond their control."
201309,63,63810,984,NA,NA,The regions have ageing populations
201309,63,63810,985,NA,NA,"Their best and brightest young people often leave for the city, and many never return."
201309,63,63810,986,2,-1,Migrants from the city or other countries do not usually settle in the regions that are most in need of new blood and ideas
201309,63,63810,987,NA,NA,The regions that beneﬁt from the inﬂux are generally on the coast or within a couple of hours of the city
201309,63,63810,988,NA,NA,Regions further away miss out.
201309,63,63810,989,NA,NA,"In addition, regions traditionally reliant on agriculture have found that their structure is changing"
201309,63,63810,990,NA,NA,"As new industries and enterprises emerge, regional economies must diversify to ensure their future."
201309,63,63810,991,NA,NA,"Those furthest away from the capital cities require support to compete for population and industry growth, and to respond to new challenges."
201309,63,63810,992,NA,NA,"Dozens of regional development programs across the nation are delivered by the three levels of government with little overall coordination, direction or evaluation, compete for regional support"
201309,63,63810,993,2,0,"In addition to the tax incentives, domestic relocation and bonded migration measures in under our Economy and Taxation plan, The Nationals commit to a fairer distribution of the growing federal funding for regional Australia through a coordinated partnership with state and local governments."
201309,63,63810,995,NA,NA,"Though fundamentally important, the provision of basic services is not alone enough to ensure regional economies prosper and grow."
201309,63,63810,996,NA,NA,"Regional growth arises from entrepreneurship, knowledge, networks and innovation from outside the region coming to set up shop."
201309,63,63810,997,NA,NA,Genuine regional development occurs when communities leverage their assets to achieve new economic opportunities.
201309,63,63810,998,NA,NA,"Innovation and entrepreneurship are central elements of successful regional economies, and communities and regions need to be encouraged by government to embrace them through more effective support for small business."

201309,63,63810,1004,NA,NA,Local communities must take a greater role in deciding the projects that will lead to economic and social beneﬁts in their areas
201309,63,63810,1005,NA,NA,"This is a hallmark of The Nationals’ Royalties for Regions policy in Western Australia, the Regional Growth Fund in Victoria and the Restart NSW Fund."
201309,63,63810,1006,NA,NA,"Better regional policy outcomes for Australia require better funding mechanisms for regional projects, and support for better focused regional institutions, where leaders are required to be strategic and visionary."

201309,63,63810,1008,NA,NA,The Nationals support the constitutional recognition of local government to ensure that the federal government is able to continue to make direct payments to local government through regional programs such as Roads to Recovery.
201309,63,63810,1009,NA,NA,We will investigate the potential use of the Federal Government’s borrowing ability to leverage cheaper borrowing costs to local governments
201309,63,63810,1010,NA,NA,"This would assist to address the backlog of infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, community halls, libraries, paths, parks, water facilities and airports."
201309,63,63810,1011,NA,NA,The Nationals support increased federal government funding for local government and we will aim to ensure that councils are fully compensated for ﬁnancial burdens associated with policies implemented by other tiers of government.

201309,63,63810,1018,NA,NA,"Good infrastructure – roads, rail, telecommunications, schools, hospitals, bridges, dams or airports – is vital to unlocking regional Australia’s potential"
201309,63,63810,1019,NA,NA,"However, soft infrastructure – such as health and allied health services, education resources, childcare and other social institutions – is also lacking and forms a barrier to regional relocation"
201309,63,63810,1020,NA,NA,The obligation of the federal government is to provide more than money
201309,63,63810,1021,NA,NA,A clearly deﬁned regional component must be identiﬁed in all long-term planning.
201309,63,63810,1022,NA,NA,"Infrastructure Australia was to deliver this integrated approach, but little has manifested since its inception in 2008"
201309,63,63810,1023,NA,NA,We will make it happen.
201309,63,63810,1024,NA,NA,We will ensure that a fair share of federal government funding for infrastructure and services is allocated to regional areas
201309,63,63810,1025,NA,NA,"Where appropriate, we write speciﬁc obligations into ﬁnancial agreements with the states, with an identiﬁed proportion of funding being allocated to regional areas."

201309,63,63810,1039,NA,NA,The new committee will have direct access to senior Ministers and will be consulted on key policy initiatives.
201309,63,63810,1041,NA,NA,The Fair Share Fund will provide resources for the following two programs:
201309,63,63810,1043,NA,NA,The need for special assistance for regions facing major structural adjustment as a result of unexpected demographic or economic change has continued under the Labor government.
201309,63,63810,1044,NA,NA,"However, Labor actions such as buying irrigation properties are adding to social and economic trauma."
201309,63,63810,1045,NA,NA,The Nationals will restore the Sustainable Regions Program in areas of Australia facing these challenges
201309,63,63810,1046,NA,NA,"The program will be designed to support projects which create employment or establish new businesses, through partnerships between the private sector, government and the community."
201309,63,63810,1047,NA,NA,"Each region will have its own advisory panel comprising business, community and local leaders, who will consult with the community to determine the economic, community and social priorities for the region, and act as a ﬁrst ﬁlter for potential projects."
201309,63,63810,1049,NA,NA,"The Nationals will broaden the Better Regions Program – a corrupted Labor version of the former Regional Partnerships program – to provide funding for community projects supported by partnership funds from state and local governments, the community, private enterprise and individuals"
201309,63,63810,1050,NA,NA,All applications will undergo rigorous assessment
201309,63,63810,1051,NA,NA,"The Better Regions Program will have three components: infrastructure project grants for large scale industry, tourism, community infrastructure and community service proposals; community grants for initiatives that increase social opportunities, community participation and interaction; and a range of small grants to help councils and not-for-proﬁt organisations with minor community projects."
201309,63,63810,1053,NA,NA,"Australians are living longer, more productive lives, and seeking to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible"
201309,63,63810,1054,NA,NA,This trend is in the government’s interest; sensible policies assisting seniors to stay home are much less costly than institutional care.
201309,63,63810,1055,NA,NA,"It is not necessarily ‘aged care’ that we look for as we get older, but healthcare and services appropriate for our stage of life."
201309,63,63810,1056,NA,NA,Key to The Nationals’ policy focus for senior Australians is the entitlement of all Australians to live with dignity throughout their lives
201309,63,63810,1057,NA,NA,"Our senior citizens should not be seen as welfare dependent, nor a drain on the economy"
201309,63,63810,1058,NA,NA,The experience and guidance of older Australians in the workforce is being recognised by employers.
201309,63,63810,1059,NA,NA,Their lifelong contribution to society should be fostered and celebrated
201309,63,63810,1060,NA,NA,"– seniors have paid their taxes, made Australia what it is today, and have more than earned their keep."
201309,63,63810,1061,NA,NA,"Older Australians enrich our communities, especially in the regions"
201309,63,63810,1062,NA,NA,"Their contribution can be seen in the essential services which keep regional communities vibrant, including policing, work in court houses, assistance in schools and hospitals, and many other community-based activities"
201309,63,63810,1063,NA,NA,Their civic service is vital to the health and vitality of regional Australia
201309,63,63810,1064,NA,NA,"Our plan is to provide the best opportunities for older Australians in regional areas to remain healthy, active and engaged in the workforce and the community"
201309,63,63810,1065,NA,NA,Ageing productively keeps people healthy and refutes any perception that seniors become a burden as our society witnesses an ageing population.
201309,63,63810,1066,NA,NA,"Where high-level full-time aged care is required, seniors must have a say in the care they receive."
201309,63,63810,1067,NA,NA,"Being in charge of one’s own life, treated as a grown up, is a dignity our seniors are entitled to expect."
201309,63,63810,1069,NA,NA,"The Nationals’ plan recognises that the great majority of older Australians contribute to society right through their later years, when community attitudes allow it, and when they are provided with the right services to remain healthy, active and engaged in the community."
201309,63,63810,1070,NA,NA,"For those in need of greater support, whether acute care or to help in overcoming social isolation, The Nationals’ plan provides for more aged care beds, better mental illness services, and practical ﬁnancial support for community groups."
201309,63,63810,1072,NA,NA,Government and the corporate sector must take on a greater role
201309,63,63810,1073,NA,NA,"The Nationals maintain that education is a lifelong experience, and the best results are achieved by governments working with business and local communities to provide high quality, appropriate facilities and services."
201309,63,63810,1074,NA,NA,"Employers need encouragement to hire and retain older staff, and to work with other employees to retrain and redeploy them in mutually agreeable roles."
201309,63,63810,1075,NA,NA,Speciﬁcally tailored training and education programs for seniors are necessary to ensure employers invest in up-skilling and re-skilling older employees
201309,63,63810,1076,NA,NA,"In addition, we will provide support for educational institutions developing programs aimed at older Australians."
201309,63,63810,1077,NA,NA,Government can improve employment rates of senior Australians in the public service
201309,63,63810,1078,NA,NA,"While departments publish the details of the senior ranks, they are less forthcoming about the number of over-60s recruited in the public service’s annual intake."
201309,63,63810,1079,NA,NA,We will further counter age discrimination by assisting the unemployed over 50 to ﬁnd meaningful work.
201309,63,63810,1080,NA,NA,"For pensioners who will undertake seasonal work, we will reform pension arrangements to support them in earning additional income"
201309,63,63810,1081,NA,NA,"In particular, we will extend the practice of income averaging for those able to undertake this work."

200509,64,64620,13,NA,NA,"but for all of us, the notion of New Zealand as a land of opportunity features in our reasons for being here."
200509,64,64620,14,NA,NA,"We owe a huge debt to those who, over many decades, came to this land as pioneers, and laid the foundations of the wonderful country we enjoy today."

200509,64,64620,19,NA,NA,"A country in which meaningful grades and reports have been disappearing from our schools,"
200509,64,64620,20,NA,NA,with large numbers of young people leaving school unable to read or write or count.
200509,64,64620,21,NA,NA,"A country in which an unhealthy alliance between the extremists and the politically correct has seen the emergence of two different standards of citizenship, depending upon your ethnicity."
200509,64,64620,22,NA,NA,"A country in which middle income folk are told by their government that they are the new rich, destined to pay 39 cents in tax on the top dollars of their income, plus a further 12½% tax on the money they spend."

200509,64,64620,37,NA,NA,"And now even behind countries we used to look down on as under-developed or developing nations, like Singapore."
200509,64,64620,38,NA,NA,How can it be that we have a growing stream of bright and energetic New Zealanders leaving for the higher standard of living they can earn abroad?
200509,64,64620,39,2,-1,How can it be that almost a quarter of all New Zealanders with a tertiary qualification now live outside this country

200509,64,64620,41,NA,NA,"And how can it be that while the world is so clearly passing New Zealand by, our government has no solutions, no answers?"

200509,64,64620,51,NA,NA,It has been said that this Clark Labour Government may well go down in history as the luckiest government of all time – given the benefits of the most favourable trading conditions for our key exports for many decades.

200509,64,64620,53,NA,NA,The good news is that the Clark Labour Government's luck has just run out.
200509,64,64620,54,NA,NA,The bad news is that New Zealand's luck is also now running out.
200509,64,64620,55,NA,NA,Our economy has slowed quite sharply.
200509,64,64620,56,NA,NA,We are reaching the end of the golden weather.
200509,64,64620,57,NA,NA,"In the six months to March of this year, the economy grew by less than 1%, and almost every forecaster expects the economy to grow at no more than about 3% for as far ahead as anyone can predict."
200509,64,64620,58,NA,NA,"The golden weather which has enabled the Labour Government to spend on hip hop tours, twilight golf courses and radio sing-along courses has come to an end."
200509,64,64620,59,NA,NA,"Sadly, the opportunity which could have been taken to set our country on a path to greater prosperity has been squandered."
200509,64,64620,60,NA,NA,"Ladies and gentlemen: from here on, we New Zealanders are going to have to make our own luck."
200509,64,64620,61,NA,NA,"From here on, New Zealand will need a government that is capable of making its own luck."
200509,64,64620,62,NA,NA,"On 17 September, New Zealanders will confront some stark choices."
200509,64,64620,63,NA,NA,"Two very different policy programmes, driven by two very different sets of values, and two very different styles of politics, will be on offer."
200509,64,64620,64,NA,NA,"It will be an important choice – indeed, a momentous choice for our country."
200509,64,64620,65,NA,NA,"Today, as we formally open our official campaign for the 2005 general election, I want to tell you about the sort of country we can be – indeed the sort of country we need to be if we are to send a message to our children and grandchildren that we can offer them a real future here."
200509,64,64620,66,NA,NA,"First, we must make this a country which rewards and respects those who want to work hard, acquire skills, and get ahead."
200509,64,64620,67,NA,NA,That is the reason that the National Party’s tax and welfare policies are so important.
200509,64,64620,68,NA,NA,"Tomorrow, I will announce the details of a comprehensive set of changes to the current tax rates."
200509,64,64620,69,NA,NA,"As will have been clear from the announcements made by John Key on Friday, following release of the Treasury’s Pre-Election Fiscal Update, our package will reduce the tax burden by $2.2 billion in year one – the 2006/07 year – rising to $3.9 billion in year three, the 2008/09 year."
200509,64,64620,70,NA,NA,"For most hard working New Zealanders, that will bring welcome relief."
200509,64,64620,71,NA,NA,"Between 2000 and 2004, the income tax paid by the average household went up by 24%, almost twice as fast as pre-tax household incomes."
200509,64,64620,72,NA,NA,"As a result, after tax and inflation, average household incomes didn’t rise at all between 2000 and 2004."
200509,64,64620,73,NA,NA,"How on earth do we expect people to work harder, to work smarter, to acquire skills, to invest more in growing their businesses if, at the end of it all, they are going to be no better off, because the government has taken the lot?"
200509,64,64620,74,NA,NA,"And if New Zealanders have no incentive to work hard in order to get ahead, how on earth is our country supposed to get ahead?"
200509,64,64620,75,NA,NA,"The programme of tax changes I will announce tomorrow is critical – not just because a few New Zealanders who see the prospect of keeping more of their hard-earned cash might decide to vote for the National Party (although I certainly hope they will), but rather because lower taxes and better incentives are the key to re-igniting the spirit of enterprise required if New Zealand is once again to be a land of opportunity."
200509,64,64620,76,NA,NA,"Over the past six years, we have seen the growth of a culture of high taxation, waste and bureaucracy."
200509,64,64620,77,NA,NA,"And that bureaucracy is suffocating not just our businesses but also our schools, our homes for the elderly, our hospitals, and our police."
200509,64,64620,78,NA,NA,It has become all pervasive.
200509,64,64620,79,NA,NA,"If we are to do better as a nation, we need a culture of enterprise, ambition and aspiration."
200509,64,64620,80,NA,NA,At the heart of that culture must be a tax system which offers incentive and reward.
200509,64,64620,81,NA,NA,"Tomorrow, I promise, you will see a package of taxation policies that will do just that."
200509,64,64620,82,NA,NA,One of the simplest changes I will formally announce tomorrow is in the field of tax on secondary employment – right at the very heart of my concern about incentives and reward.
200509,64,64620,83,NA,NA,"Those who take on a second job today often find their tax being collected at a very high rate, with the onus falling on them to collect a refund many months later."
200509,64,64620,84,NA,NA,"That in itself is a major disincentive to getting ahead,"
200509,64,64620,85,NA,NA,"and often the result is that they end up not getting their refund – indeed, faced with that high tax on secondary employment, they often decide against that extra job!"
200509,64,64620,86,NA,NA,"The New Zealand I hope to lead will be one where we reward, not punish, those who want to get ahead by taking on a second job."
200509,64,64620,87,NA,NA,So we will change the way in which tax is collected on secondary employment.
200509,64,64620,88,NA,NA,"We will collect that tax at a rate below 20 cents in the dollar, unless the taxpayer asks, in anticipation of a higher tax obligation, for collection to be at a nominated higher rate."
200509,64,64620,89,NA,NA,"We will do this because we want to remove every obstacle we can standing in the way of those who want to get ahead, whose efforts will see New Zealand get ahead."
200509,64,64620,90,NA,NA,Hand in hand with our tax policy will be our welfare policy.
200509,64,64620,91,NA,NA,"It should be a matter of great shame to this nation that, at the peak of the economic cycle, we have 300,000 working age New Zealanders on a full time benefit – 110,000 of whom have been on a benefit for at least four years."
200509,64,64620,92,NA,NA,The waste of taxpayers’ money – at a cost of $14 million every day – is bad enough.
200509,64,64620,93,NA,NA,But the waste of those lives is a human tragedy of enormous proportions.
200509,64,64620,94,NA,NA,"A National Government is committed to strongly supporting those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to support themselves."
200509,64,64620,95,NA,NA,"But for those who are unemployed and able to work, we will find work."
200509,64,64620,96,NA,NA,Those on the domestic purposes benefit will be expected to be available for part time work when their youngest child goes to school – something that tens of thousands of tax-paying mothers decide to do of their own volition.
200509,64,64620,97,NA,NA,And the sickness and invalids benefits will cease to be a place to hide for those who have no legitimate entitlement to taxpayers’ support.
200509,64,64620,98,NA,NA,"So we are offering a package of sensible and fair taxation and welfare policies that encourage New Zealanders to get ahead,"
200509,64,64620,99,NA,NA,and see their country get ahead.
200509,64,64620,100,NA,NA,But the risk to this country lies not just in continuing to slip further behind economically.
200509,64,64620,101,NA,NA,"New Zealand is also at risk from a growing acceptance, indeed encouragement, of mediocrity in far too many aspects of our national life."
200509,64,64620,102,NA,NA,"Yes, our best sports people are in the top international league,"
200509,64,64620,103,NA,NA,but too often our children are discouraged from trying hard to win.
200509,64,64620,104,NA,NA,"Yes, our best educated people are amongst the best educated in the world,"
200509,64,64620,105,NA,NA,"but too many of our schools no longer celebrate those who do outstandingly well, no longer give marks, no longer give meaningful grades."
200509,64,64620,106,NA,NA,"And in the tertiary sector, we have seen scandalous amounts of money wasted on courses of minimal value either to those enrolled or to the wider New Zealand society"
200509,64,64620,107,NA,NA,– with university funding up just 28% over the last five years
200509,64,64620,108,NA,NA,but spending on low quality community education courses up more than 800%.
200509,64,64620,109,NA,NA,"These are sure signs of a society that has lost its way, lost its focus, lost its sense of values."
200509,64,64620,110,NA,NA,"In particular, we have lost our focus on the core public services which people should be entitled to expect from the government they fund with their taxes."
200509,64,64620,111,NA,NA,"And so the second promise I make to you today is that the next National Government will focus on excellent delivery of the services that New Zealanders expect in return for their tax dollars,"
200509,64,64620,112,NA,NA,because those services are a critical building block in the better performing economy we must have.
200509,64,64620,113,NA,NA,And because they are essential to the civilised society which we generally expect.
200509,64,64620,114,NA,NA,In no area is that more important than in Education.
200509,64,64620,115,NA,NA,"I am totally committed to a New Zealand in which every child gets the very best education of which they are capable,"
200509,64,64620,116,NA,NA,"one in which their parents will have choices about where and how their children will be educated,"
200509,64,64620,117,NA,NA,and one in which schools have the freedom to operate in the interests of their communities.
200509,64,64620,118,NA,NA,That is why the next National Government will take the education sector out of the bureaucratic and union-dominated straightjacket in which it is now trapped.
200509,64,64620,119,NA,NA,We will abolish rigid school zoning.
200509,64,64620,120,NA,NA,We will improve the quality of teacher training
200509,64,64620,121,NA,NA,and ensure that good teachers are paid more.
200509,64,64620,122,NA,NA,We will remove the cap on the rolls of the integrated schools
200509,64,64620,123,NA,NA,and restore to the 1999 level the subsidies for independent schools
200509,64,64620,124,NA,NA,in order to enhance parental choice.
200509,64,64620,125,NA,NA,We will fix the NCEA.
200509,64,64620,126,NA,NA,"When a child falls behind in reading or arithmetic, we will give their parents a voucher to buy the extra tuition they need."
200509,64,64620,127,NA,NA,"And we will let schools be run by their boards, communities and principals, not by teacher unions, bureaucrats, and heavy-handed Ministers."
200509,64,64620,128,NA,NA,"There is no point in creating a wealthier, better educated, nation if New Zealanders cannot feel safe in their own homes."
200509,64,64620,129,NA,NA,"Again, as the Clark Labour Government has been carried away with its hip hop tours and its twilight golf courses,"
200509,64,64620,130,NA,NA,it has lost sight of one of the most important roles of any government: the protection of its citizens.
200509,64,64620,131,NA,NA,"As will be evident to any New Zealander who has read a newspaper in recent months, the quality of New Zealand policing has been put at risk on Helen Clark’s watch."
200509,64,64620,132,NA,NA,And public confidence in the police has also been put at risk.
200509,64,64620,133,NA,NA,Let me be very clear about this:
200509,64,64620,134,NA,NA,"I, Don Brash, will place the protection of New Zealand’s citizens right at the very top of the list of solemn duties of the Prime Minister of this land."
200509,64,64620,135,NA,NA,"Under a National Government, police resources will be devoted to fighting crime, not to filling in forms or raising revenue by filling speeding ticket quotas."
200509,64,64620,136,NA,NA,We will abolish parole for all repeat and violent offenders.
200509,64,64620,137,NA,NA,We will change the Proceeds of Crime legislation to enable the police to smash organised criminal gangs.
200509,64,64620,138,NA,NA,And we will maintain a DNA data base of all people convicted of a criminal offence to ensure speedier resolution of many offences.
200509,64,64620,139,NA,NA,"A Don Brash-led Government will get serious about protecting New Zealand’s citizens, and get tough with the small minority of violent anti-social thugs who are currently re-cycled through our courts and through our police files again and again and again."
200509,64,64620,140,NA,NA,"No single area better illustrates the “spend now, think later” approach of the Clark Labour Government than Health."
200509,64,64620,141,NA,NA,"If six years ago you had asked me whether it was possible to increase health funding by 50%, and get virtually no more operations, no more services out of the health system, I would have said that would have been a challenge."
200509,64,64620,142,NA,NA,But clearly the Clark Labour Government has been equal to that challenge.
200509,64,64620,143,NA,NA,"Today, they preside over a health system which consumes more dollars and produces less value for money than most of us could ever have believed."
200509,64,64620,144,NA,NA,More money will help.
200509,64,64620,145,NA,NA,But there are problems in our health system that money alone will not fix.
200509,64,64620,146,NA,NA,"The next National Government is going to be driven not by ideology, not by blind prejudice, but by a simple and unambiguous requirement that we use taxpayers’ money to buy the very best health services for our people,"
200509,64,64620,147,NA,NA,regardless of whether they are delivered by the public or by the private sector.
200509,64,64620,148,NA,NA,And we will maintain the levels of funding required to deliver the quality and quantity of healthcare that New Zealanders expect.
200509,64,64620,149,NA,NA,There is one other core service funded by New Zealand taxpayers which I want to mention in this context.
200509,64,64620,150,1,0,The decisions as to who qualifies to become a citizen of our country must sit very high on the hierarchy of responsibilities of the government of our land.
200509,64,64620,151,NA,NA,Yet the exercise of that responsibility has been seriously deficient in recent years.
200509,64,64620,152,1,-1,"Scandal after scandal has occurred in the Immigration portfolio, to the point where we are almost de-sensitised to the headlines."
200509,64,64620,153,1,0,"A National Government will give the Immigration Service a major, top to bottom, overhaul"
200509,64,64620,154,1,0,", and roll the Service into a new Ministry that draws together the functions of the Immigration Service and the Citizenship role of the Ministry of Internal Affairs."
200509,64,64620,155,NA,NA,A National Government will ensure we treat the task of deciding who gets to be a New Zealander with the seriousness and professionalism it deserves.
200509,64,64620,156,1,0,"The concerns I have alluded to today – about taxation, welfare, education, law and order, immigration, and health – are to the forefront of the National Party’s agenda."
200509,64,64620,157,NA,NA,"They are also to some extent on the agendas of the other parties of the centre-right, and that gives me real confidence in our ability to see these issues addressed by a National-led Government."
200509,64,64620,158,NA,NA,Finally today I want to promise New Zealanders a different style of political leadership after 17 September.
200509,64,64620,159,NA,NA,"Over recent weeks, Helen Clark and her senior Ministers have attempted to make much of my relative lack of Parliamentary experience – even though it is about the same as that enjoyed by Bob Hawke before he became Prime Minister of Australia."
200509,64,64620,160,NA,NA,Well I have two things to say about that:
200509,64,64620,161,NA,NA,"Last time I saw one of those polls measuring public respect for various occupational groups, politicians were giving used car salesmen and mad axe murderers a run for their money somewhere near the bottom of the list!"
200509,64,64620,162,NA,NA,So I feel no particular anxiety about being excluded from that assessment.
200509,64,64620,163,NA,NA,"But if my opponents are, by referring to my Parliamentary experience, suggesting that I might, as Prime Minister, do things differently from the incumbent, then my answer is: Absolutely, yes."
200509,64,64620,164,NA,NA,"If the public of this country accord me the privilege of serving as Prime Minister after September 17, things will be different."
200509,64,64620,165,NA,NA,"Very, very different."
200509,64,64620,166,NA,NA,"For a start, if my ministerial limousine is travelling at 160 kilometres an hour, I promise I will notice."
200509,64,64620,167,NA,NA,"And if I sign a painting, it will be because I painted it."
200509,64,64620,168,NA,NA,"I promise to end the era of government by smoke and mirrors, and the rule of the Beehive spin merchants."
200509,64,64620,169,NA,NA,"I promise an end to the creeping, some would say galloping, political correctness which has overrun our ship of state."
200509,64,64620,170,NA,NA,"And I promise that when something goes wrong, it won’t always have been the officials’ or the driver’s fault."
200509,64,64620,171,NA,NA,"I promise you a government of mainstream New Zealanders, for mainstream New Zealanders."
200509,64,64620,172,NA,NA,"I may not have started the debate in this country over the place of the Treaty of Waitangi, but I think it would be fair to say that I did nudge it along a bit."
200509,64,64620,173,NA,NA,"And if I am elected to the office of Prime Minister, I will use every ounce of energy in my body to see us create a country in which all New Zealanders, regardless of their ethnicity, are treated as equals before the law,"
200509,64,64620,174,NA,NA,"and in which the historic Treaty claims are settled with speed,"
200509,64,64620,175,NA,NA,with fairness
200509,64,64620,176,NA,NA,and with dignity.
200509,64,64620,177,NA,NA,"My vision is of a country in which we all, regardless of background, regardless of race, can find our own land of opportunity,"
200509,64,64620,178,NA,NA,"not through the endless re-interpretation of a document signed in a different time and for a different purpose,"
200509,64,64620,179,NA,NA,"but through an understanding that we have a shared future, a common stake in this great land of ours."
200509,64,64620,180,NA,NA,"If you want the continuation of a politically correct, social engineering, arrogant government, which has done nothing to improve our growth rate or stem the exodus of Kiwis to greener pastures abroad and which believes it can spend your money better than you can, I suggest you don’t vote National."
200509,64,64620,181,NA,NA,"But if you share our vision of what New Zealand could become – a country with living standards at least equal to those in Australia,"
200509,64,64620,182,NA,NA,"where every child gets the very best education of which they are capable,"
200509,64,64620,183,NA,NA,where those who need help from government get it
200509,64,64620,184,NA,NA,"but those who don’t need it stand on their own two feet,"
200509,64,64620,185,NA,NA,where eliminating crime is taken seriously
200509,64,64620,186,NA,NA,and where every person is equal before the law
200509,64,64620,187,NA,NA,– then know that the National Party stands ready to deliver the policies to make that future a reality.
200509,64,64620,188,NA,NA,"On 17 September, I invite all New Zealanders to join us on that journey."
200811,64,64110,9,NA,NA,The real question we need to ask at this election is who will be the voice for those who have no voice.
200811,64,64110,10,NA,NA,Who will be the voice for children?
200811,64,64110,11,NA,NA,"900,000 children and young people can’t vote at this election - 900,000 children and young people who have a deep interest in the future of this country and this planet."
200811,64,64110,12,NA,NA,They have more at stake than anyone else – it’s them that will inherit the world we leave.
200811,64,64110,13,NA,NA,Who will be their voice in parliament?
200811,64,64110,14,NA,NA,The Green Party will be the voice for those who will inherit the earth.
200811,64,64110,15,NA,NA,Who will speak out for parents’ right to know where their kids’ food comes from?
200811,64,64110,16,NA,NA,"At a time when Labour and National gang up together, united against the right of a parent to know the true source of their children’s food,"
200811,64,64110,17,NA,NA,which party has the basic human decency to say people have a basic human right to know where their food comes from?
200811,64,64110,18,NA,NA,"The Green Party will speak out for people’s right to know,"
200811,64,64110,19,NA,NA,while Labour and National protect agribusiness’ right to make money.
200811,64,64110,20,NA,NA,And who will tell Fonterra and the rest that it’s not good enough to sit on your hands while the authoritarian Chinese Government suppresses the truth about poison milk;
200811,64,64110,21,NA,NA,it’s not good enough to look the other way while the Chinese Government spies on anyone using the words ‘milk powder’ on Skype.
200811,64,64110,22,NA,NA,"Helen Clark belatedly complained that Fonterra took too long to go public while her government didn’t go public either, after they found out about poisoned milk,"
200811,64,64110,23,NA,NA,and it wasn’t recalled for 20 days after the New Zealand government was officially notified by Fonterra.
200811,64,64110,24,NA,NA,If you can’t trust Labour and National to go public about poisoned baby milk then what on earth can you trust them on.
200811,64,64110,25,NA,NA,"Surely staying quiet about poisoned baby milk is some kind of moral Rubicon which we would never expect a New Zealand government to cross, and then they did."
200811,64,64110,26,NA,NA,"Who will be the voice who speaks out about poisoned baby food, only the Greens."
200811,64,64110,27,NA,NA,Who can you trust to take a precautionary approach to food safety?
200811,64,64110,28,NA,NA,Who will support sustainable organic food production
200811,64,64110,29,NA,NA,and protect kids
200811,64,64110,30,NA,NA,"and our clean, green reputation."
200811,64,64110,31,NA,NA,The Green Party.
200811,64,64110,32,NA,NA,Who will be the voice for the children of the future who will miss out on swimming in a New Zealand river because it’s so polluted it’s dangerous?
200811,64,64110,33,NA,NA,Kiwi parents who had a baby 10 years ago might have expected that their child would today be able to swim in the rivers and streams where they themselves swam as children.
200811,64,64110,34,NA,NA,Yet now that 10 year old child can’t safely swim in most of our rivers because they are so polluted with effluent from agribusiness.
200811,64,64110,35,NA,NA,Who will be the voice for the children of today and tomorrow who will never have a chance to swim in a clean river while Labour and National are in control?

200811,64,64110,156,NA,NA,There’s a call for change at this election.
200811,64,64110,157,NA,NA,People get tired of leaders and of political parties just as they get tired of their furniture and it seems time to rearrange the room or go out and buy some new stuff.
200811,64,64110,158,NA,NA,Change is exciting – you don’t know quite how it will turn out!
200811,64,64110,159,NA,NA,But no-one seems very clear what they want to change to.

200811,64,64110,166,NA,NA,Both of them say we should do something about climate change but something called “the economy” has to come first.
200811,64,64110,167,NA,NA,After repeated overseas food safety scares neither of them will defend your right to know where your food comes from so you can make your own decisions.
200811,64,64110,168,NA,NA,Both will take us into a Free Trade Agreement with the US that will allow transnational pharmaceutical companies to undermine our low cost system of generic medicines and vastly increase the cost of being sick.
200811,64,64110,169,NA,NA,"The US will also demand the right for its corporations to buy our land and to sell their GE food and their GE seeds for planting into New Zealand, unlabeled."
200811,64,64110,170,NA,NA,"Both Mother Coke and Father Pepsi actively welcome and fund a future of genetically engineered food, grown here."
200811,64,64110,171,NA,NA,"The only differences I can detect is that Labour is more gung ho about GE than National, who prefer to just let it happen through the market;"
200811,64,64110,172,NA,NA,"but National wants to further weaken what rules we do have, in the interests of reducing compliance costs!"
200811,64,64110,173,NA,NA,Neither will do anything to encourage organic growing except when the Greens have the power to push them.

200811,64,64110,178,NA,NA,Who do you trust to take urgent action on climate change
200811,64,64110,179,NA,NA,and to prepare for rising oil prices?
200811,64,64110,180,NA,NA,To get our cities moving with a functioning public transport system

200811,64,64110,186,NA,NA,"If these are the things you care about, why would you change from grey to grey?"
200811,64,64110,187,NA,NA,"If these are the things you care about, then the change you need is Green."
200811,64,64110,188,NA,NA,There’s no doubt that 12 Green MPs – 10 even – would change any government.
200811,64,64110,189,NA,NA,"Even with six, we already have."
200811,64,64110,190,NA,NA,And that’s without even being part of Government.
200811,64,64110,191,NA,NA,"We are ready to play a role around the Cabinet table if we are asked,"
200811,64,64110,192,NA,NA,and if we are offered a policy agreement that meets the present and future needs of our children.
200811,64,64110,193,NA,NA,During the coming week we’ll be releasing the criteria against which we will judge the policies and programmes of other parties and deciding who we could work with in future.
200811,64,64110,194,NA,NA,But round the Cabinet table is not the only way to make change.

200811,64,64110,214,NA,NA,"Our first bill in Parliament, introduced 10 years ago, set the framework for a comprehensive energy efficiency system."

200811,64,64110,227,NA,NA,and the lobbying and shaming we have done to change government policy.
200811,64,64110,228,NA,NA,We contributed to the pressure to raise the minimum wage

200811,64,64110,260,NA,NA,It is empowering stuff.
200811,64,64110,261,NA,NA,"But my message to those who have recently discovered this empowering way of life, is that if you are thinking green and acting green, it also matters deeply how you vote."
200811,64,64110,262,NA,NA,"You can grow your vegies and insulate your house and ride a bike, but you can’t build your own public transport system."

200811,64,64320,6,NA,NA,And these are challenging times – for our world.
200811,64,64320,7,NA,NA,"Our country, while resilient, is not immune to what is happening."
200811,64,64320,8,NA,NA,Our world is experiencing the worst financial crisis seen since the 1930s.
200811,64,64320,9,NA,NA,A curtain is being drawn on the era of the free wheeling unregulated money traders and financiers whose greed has shaken the international financial system to its very core.
200811,64,64320,10,NA,NA,Co-ordinated international action will be needed
200811,64,64320,11,NA,NA,to ensure that the greed merchants don’t ever again get the chance to destroy the lives of ordinary people in real jobs

200811,64,64320,14,NA,NA,Who could have envisaged even six weeks ago the US Government would undertake a $US700 billion bail out – or Britain a part nationalisation of major banks?
200811,64,64320,15,NA,NA,"At present, New Zealand and Australia have escaped the worst of the storm, as the quality of the assets in our banking systems has been higher."
200811,64,64320,16,NA,NA,The Reserve Bank has already been intervening in the market
200811,64,64320,17,NA,NA,"to ensure that liquidity is maintained,"
200811,64,64320,18,NA,NA,and the Government has agreed to implement a deposit guarantee scheme which will provide New Zealand depositors with additional confidence.

200811,64,64320,20,NA,NA,Both the Government and the Bank are committed to doing what needs to be done to keep the New Zealand system safe.
200811,64,64320,21,NA,NA,You can count on us to use sound judgement and to be resolute through these challenging times.
200811,64,64320,22,NA,NA,"Our great party, the oldest in New Zealand, responded effectively to the depression in the 1930s."
200811,64,64320,23,NA,NA,Our opponents then had failed dismally and must not be given the opportunity to let New Zealand down again.
200811,64,64320,24,NA,NA,At the international level the challenge now is to stop the financial market crisis turning into a full-blown economic crisis.
200811,64,64320,25,NA,NA,Projections of world economic growth have been trimmed.
200811,64,64320,26,NA,NA,That includes forecasts for New Zealand in the near term.
200811,64,64320,27,NA,NA,Our country is coming off eight years of good growth by developed world standards – ours was still at 3.2 per cent in the year to last December.
200811,64,64320,28,NA,NA,"The latest forecasts are for a flat year in the year to March, and 1.8 per cent growth in the following year, before returning to growth of over three per cent."
200811,64,64320,29,NA,NA,But these forecasts were completed before the last few extraordinary weeks on world financial markets.
200811,64,64320,30,NA,NA,"At times like these, it is important to have a plan"
200811,64,64320,31,NA,NA,"– not a knee-jerk reaction, and it is certainly important not to panic."
200811,64,64320,32,NA,NA,Nor is complacency an option.
200811,64,64320,33,NA,NA,It is at times like these that we New Zealanders must ask who do we really trust with the future of our economy and our country.
200811,64,64320,34,NA,NA,"It is at times like these that we need a vision for growth and investment, and a plan to make it happen."
200811,64,64320,35,NA,NA,It is at times like these that we must have a plan which helps all our people move forward – and does not just abandon the poorest to the cool economic winds.
200811,64,64320,36,NA,NA,"Labour has six priorities for building a strong, upmarket economy,"
200811,64,64320,37,NA,NA,"driven by skills and innovation,"

200811,64,64320,41,NA,NA,and committed to sustainability.
200811,64,64320,42,NA,NA,"Our plan addresses these six critical areas for growth and investment in the short, medium, and long term, and I am focusing on them today."
200811,64,64320,43,NA,NA,I’ll also be indicating the kind of new measures the government is prepared to take to ensure that the economy doesn’t stagnate and unemployment doesn’t take off as a result of this international crisis.
200811,64,64320,44,NA,NA,I make no apology for beginning with our commitment to education and skills training.
200811,64,64320,45,NA,NA,"He tangata, he tangata, he tangata – the development of our people must come first."
200811,64,64320,46,NA,NA,All our people must have the opportunity to reach their full potential
200811,64,64320,47,NA,NA,– and have the chance to fill the skilled job slots available in the economy.
200811,64,64320,48,NA,NA,Even now employers are experiencing difficulty finding skilled labour.
200811,64,64320,49,NA,NA,We’ve set out a big vision for the future of secondary education to improve our young people’s chances of success.
200811,64,64320,50,NA,NA,"Under Schools Plus, we want our schools to be able to respond to the full range of abilities of our teenagers – and to make education relevant and personal to all our young people."
200811,64,64320,51,NA,NA,By 2011 we will have youth apprenticeships available in every high school in New Zealand for students from Year Nine on.
200811,64,64320,52,NA,NA,"From 2011, every student from Year 9 on will have their personal education plan – agreed between them, their school and their family."
200811,64,64320,53,NA,NA,"From 2011 there will be an education or training leaving age of seventeen, and from 2014 of eighteen."
200811,64,64320,54,NA,NA,Not all those students will be in school – but they will still be learning in work or in training.
200811,64,64320,55,NA,NA,We want those students to be able to move on to new opportunities in apprenticeships and industry training.
200811,64,64320,56,NA,NA,"By the end of this year we will have approximately 14,000 young people in Modern Apprenticeships training."
200811,64,64320,57,NA,NA,"· Our new target is that in each year, over the next three years we will add another 1000 – to reach 17,000 in Modern Apprenticeship training by the end of 2011."
200811,64,64320,58,NA,NA,"As well, we are lifting our target for the numbers of Kiwis in industry training in the course of each year."
200811,64,64320,59,NA,NA,"Last year, there were over 185,000."
200811,64,64320,60,NA,NA,· Our new target is to lift those numbers in training to ten per cent of the work force.
200811,64,64320,61,NA,NA,"· That means that by 2011 we aim to have 230,000 people in recognised training."
200811,64,64320,62,NA,NA,"These new targets will help us achieve the goals of the New Zealand Skills Strategy – a visionary strategy for a highly skilled workforce,"
200811,64,64320,63,NA,NA,"developed by government with Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, and the Industry Training Federation – and I thank them all for their co-operation."
200811,64,64320,64,NA,NA,"But in the near term, the prospect of fall out from the international crisis requires us to have new plans for workers whose jobs might be affected."
200811,64,64320,65,NA,NA,"I am announcing today that Labour will introduce a new retraining allowance, on the same basis as a student allowance, but with no spousal income test, for workers who have been in the workforce for at least five years and have been made redundant."
200811,64,64320,66,NA,NA,An allowance will also be available to those who have been in the workforce for ten years and wish to upgrade their skills or retrain in a new area.
200811,64,64320,67,NA,NA,"These allowances will be available for up to a year for enrolment in a recognised full time course,"
200811,64,64320,68,NA,NA,including to those who have previously used up their full time student allowance entitlement.
200811,64,64320,69,NA,NA,"My dream has always been to enable our young people – and mature students – to have the kind of support my generation had in full time, quality tertiary education."
200811,64,64320,70,NA,NA,We have to keep investing in our people.
200811,64,64320,71,NA,NA,This is critical to realising our goals for a knowledge led economy and society.
200811,64,64320,72,NA,NA,I will address these issues in my speech at Otago University tomorrow.
200811,64,64320,73,NA,NA,Skilled and educated people will drive the innovation needed for our economy to grow and develop.
200811,64,64320,74,NA,NA,Labour wants New Zealand to be a smart economy – not a dumb economy.
200811,64,64320,75,NA,NA,For years our companies cried out for a tax regime which would support them doing the research and development
200811,64,64320,76,NA,NA,which is so critical to developing a high value economy.
200811,64,64320,77,NA,NA,We responded in Budget 07 with a tax credit of fifteen per cent of allowable R and D expenditure.
200811,64,64320,78,NA,NA,It came into effect on 1 April this year and is expected to increase private sector R & D significantly.
200811,64,64320,79,NA,NA,"Our R & D tax credit is considered by many to be superior to Australia’s, and there are signs that it is beginning to attract R & D investment."
200811,64,64320,80,NA,NA,"Who, other than the most small minded plodding, short term-focused conservatives, would want to trash that and risk losing R & D investment and innovative companies to Australia?"
200811,64,64320,81,NA,NA,Labour is committed to working with our smart companies to grow this economy.
200811,64,64320,82,NA,NA,And we are committed to working with the big pastoral and food sectors to boost the value of what they export.
200811,64,64320,83,NA,NA,We have put $700 million up for innovation there through the Fast Forward Fund – and industry have committed to match it.
200811,64,64320,84,NA,NA,This is the kind of vision we must have to transform our nation's future prospects and lift our people’s living standards.
200811,64,64320,85,NA,NA,"Labour backs innovation,"
200811,64,64320,86,NA,NA,and we back education and skills for the people who will drive it.
200811,64,64320,87,NA,NA,And that means driving our export trade forward too – the third element of our plan.
200811,64,64320,88,NA,NA,"On behalf of New Zealand, Phil Goff and I have been relentless in working to open up markets for Kiwi exporters."
200811,64,64320,89,NA,NA,"The Free Trade Agreement with China was our biggest, boldest move."
200811,64,64320,90,NA,NA,It is even more significant now as developed economies are in or near recession.
200811,64,64320,91,NA,NA,"Growth in China, while clipped, is still significant."
200811,64,64320,92,NA,NA,It is to our great benefit that we are well placed in their market of 1.2 billion people.
200811,64,64320,93,NA,NA,We have just concluded negotiations on an FTA with all of ASEAN – a market of half a billion people.
200811,64,64320,94,NA,NA,"We are in FTA talks with the Gulf states, and in preparatory talks with Korea."
200811,64,64320,95,NA,NA,"We have a foot in the door to study an FTA with Japan, and a study is underway with India."
200811,64,64320,96,NA,NA,But wait – there is more.
200811,64,64320,97,NA,NA,"The National Party said that because we were ''missing in action'' in Iraq, we would never get an FTA with the United States."
200811,64,64320,98,NA,NA,I would rather New Zealand was missing in action in Iraq than have our soldiers missing in action in a war when the cause was not right.
200811,64,64320,99,NA,NA,Our foreign policy has always been conducted on a principled basis and always will be.
200811,64,64320,100,NA,NA,That means acting with integrity and treating each issue on its merits.
200811,64,64320,101,NA,NA,Now the United States has agreed to negotiate with New Zealand and three other friends on a Trans-Pacific FTA.
200811,64,64320,102,NA,NA,We have far more in common with the United States of America as a fellow Western nation than we have with most countries.
200811,64,64320,103,NA,NA,"It is recognition of that common interest, in the context of only relatively isolated differences, which has enabled us to move forward."
200811,64,64320,104,NA,NA,Closely linked to our plans for export trade is our plan for New Zealand to become more sustainable. – the fourth plank in our platform for advancing our economy.
200811,64,64320,105,NA,NA,"Under Labour, New Zealand has risen to the sustainability challenge because it is the right thing to do for our planet – and because it is the smart thing to do for our economy."
200811,64,64320,106,NA,NA,Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our times – and it cries out for leadership from all nations.
200811,64,64320,107,NA,NA,Labour in New Zealand provides that leadership.
200811,64,64320,108,NA,NA,It is not in our nature to be a fast follower.
200811,64,64320,109,NA,NA,New Zealand is better than that.
200811,64,64320,110,NA,NA,"We did not wait for others to lead us on votes for women,"
200811,64,64320,111,NA,NA,"social security,"
200811,64,64320,112,NA,NA,and being nuclear free.
200811,64,64320,113,NA,NA,"We proudly led the world on those,"
200811,64,64320,114,NA,NA,and we will lead on sustainability too.
200811,64,64320,115,NA,NA,We now have a world leading emissions trading scheme.
200811,64,64320,116,NA,NA,We have biofuels in our fuel mix.
200811,64,64320,117,NA,NA,We are promoting renewable energy
200811,64,64320,118,NA,NA,and reafforestation.
200811,64,64320,119,NA,NA,We have many measures for energy efficiency and conservation.
200811,64,64320,120,NA,NA,We are investing heavily in our public transport and rail systems.
200811,64,64320,121,NA,NA,"In these and many other ways, we will get our greenhouse gas emissions down."
200811,64,64320,122,NA,NA,"For the sake of our economy, we must show that we care and we will act."
200811,64,64320,123,NA,NA,"In our most affluent export markets, consumers are making ethical decisions about what goods and services they will buy."
200811,64,64320,124,NA,NA,"If New Zealand goods and services lack environmental integrity, we will suffer."
200811,64,64320,125,NA,NA,We have fantastic opportunities to capitalise on our clean and green brand –
200811,64,64320,126,NA,NA,and with the commitment Labour has made to sustainability we will.
200811,64,64320,127,NA,NA,The fifth driver of growth is investment in infrastructure.
200811,64,64320,128,NA,NA,This also has a role to play in navigating our economy through the effects of the current crisis.
200811,64,64320,129,NA,NA,"Over nine years, we have doubled annual funding in roading."
200811,64,64320,130,NA,NA,Investment in public transport is fifteen times larger.
200811,64,64320,131,NA,NA,We have put up half a billion dollars for investment in the rail track.
200811,64,64320,132,NA,NA,We have bought back both the track and the rail service
200811,64,64320,133,NA,NA,– and the major shareholding in Air New Zealand.
200811,64,64320,134,NA,NA,"In Labour, we do not think public ownership is a sin!"
200811,64,64320,135,NA,NA,"We believe there are many things which must be kept Kiwi, and that includes Kiwibank."
200811,64,64320,136,NA,NA,We have made huge commitments to invest in electricity transmission and generation.
200811,64,64320,137,NA,NA,The next 3 – 4 years see plans overall for investment in renewable generation of $3.5 to $4 billion.
200811,64,64320,138,NA,NA,We are implementing a half billion dollar plan for super fast broadband – in a five year down payment on our ten year plan to speed up internet access radically.
200811,64,64320,139,NA,NA,We have spent three times as much on public health infrastructure in the last nine years as there was in the previous nine.
200811,64,64320,140,NA,NA,"And billions more dollars have gone into capital works across our schools, justice, policing and other infrastructure."
200811,64,64320,141,NA,NA,Our budgets set out a big forward programme for physical infrastructure – at $5.4 billion this year alone – 180 per cent above 1999 levels.
200811,64,64320,142,NA,NA,"Now, taking into account the international financial crisis, Labour is developing an additional stimulus package for investment in infrastructure should conditions not improve."
200811,64,64320,143,NA,NA,It is incumbent on us to show leadership
200811,64,64320,144,NA,NA,so that a financial crisis offshore does not lead to depression in New Zealand with widespread unemployment.
200811,64,64320,145,NA,NA,Labour is not prepared to stand by and see that happen.
200811,64,64320,146,NA,NA,We will be prepared to bring forward spending on infrastructure and other initiatives to create real jobs
200811,64,64320,147,NA,NA,and build the potential for future growth.
200811,64,64320,148,NA,NA,"When growth is slowing, it’s time to tune the growth engines, not slow them down"
200811,64,64320,149,NA,NA,or demolish them as our opponents are proposing.
200811,64,64320,150,NA,NA,So a key part of our plan to deal with downside risks to the economy is to develop a package which would:

200811,64,64320,154,NA,NA,I am releasing details today of the kinds of projects which could be brought forward.
200811,64,64320,155,NA,NA,"· They could include key rail and road projects, - like work on the North South junction north of Wellington."
200811,64,64320,156,NA,NA,"· At the moment, tunnels there are too small to allow new sized containers to be carried by rail, so they have to be transferred to the road."
200811,64,64320,157,NA,NA,· This has to be fixed.
200811,64,64320,158,NA,NA,· We could also bring forward the projected rail link to Marsden Point.
200811,64,64320,159,NA,NA,The projects could also include
200811,64,64320,160,NA,NA,· expanding our sewerage subsidy scheme to support currently unfunded local government proposals
200811,64,64320,161,NA,NA,· bringing forward school property proposals which are presently in the unfunded queue.
200811,64,64320,162,NA,NA,· further support for back country reafforestation.
200811,64,64320,163,NA,NA,Initiatives in all these areas are expected to be job rich and can be embarked on if New Zealand risks a hard landing from the present crises.
200811,64,64320,164,NA,NA,"In addition to the kinds of projects I’ve already mentioned, in the next few days I will announce further proposals to stimulate the supply of affordable housing,"
200811,64,64320,165,NA,NA,both to help modest income earners buy their own home
200811,64,64320,166,NA,NA,and to support greater continuity of employment in the house building sector.
200811,64,64320,167,NA,NA,"Given the privilege of re-election, Labour in government will move to prepare a formal economic statement for release in December setting out the steps to be taken to reignite the economy, including steps along the lines I have indicated today."
200811,64,64320,168,NA,NA,"While Labour will not be cutting overall public spending, we will reprioritise to ensure a focus on those areas which will be of the most assistance in the current economic and financial circumstances."
200811,64,64320,169,NA,NA,The sixth driver of our economic plan relates to boosting savings.
200811,64,64320,170,NA,NA,"Over nine years in government, we have been building a substantial New Zealand Superannuation Fund,"
200811,64,64320,171,NA,NA,"reintroduced a public service retirement savings scheme,"
200811,64,64320,172,NA,NA,and launched KiwiSaver.
200811,64,64320,173,NA,NA,"More than 800,000 New Zealanders have chosen to invest in their future through KiwiSaver."
200811,64,64320,174,NA,NA,"Under Labour, KiwiSaver will help Kiwis buy their first home"
200811,64,64320,175,NA,NA,and have a much more comfortable retirement.
200811,64,64320,176,NA,NA,"Under Labour, KiwiSaver will boost our savings and help deepen our capital markets."
200811,64,64320,177,NA,NA,It is widely acknowledged that two of the most pressing issues to address in the Kiwi economy are innovation
200811,64,64320,178,NA,NA,and boosting savings.
200811,64,64320,179,NA,NA,Both are big investments in our future.
200811,64,64320,180,NA,NA,"To trash those investments for inequitable and short term tax cuts, which do nothing for modest income families and make everyone in KiwiSaver worse off, would be a massive step backwards for New Zealand"
200811,64,64320,181,NA,NA,– and Labour in government will never let that happen.
200811,64,64320,182,NA,NA,"In the 1970s a previous National Government destroyed Labour’s superannuation scheme,"
200811,64,64320,183,NA,NA,depriving our country of the chance to build up substantial savings.
200811,64,64320,184,NA,NA,Muldoon’s mokopuna must not be allowed to do that again.
200811,64,64320,185,NA,NA,My focus today has been on the pathway we must follow to grow and invest in our economy during these very challenging international conditions.
200811,64,64320,186,NA,NA,"I have discussed our six drivers of growth,"
200811,64,64320,187,NA,NA,with significant new steps which can be taken should current conditions not improve.
200811,64,64320,188,NA,NA,There is of course another plan on the market – it has five points:
200811,64,64320,189,NA,NA,"· tinkering with tax cuts – except at the upper end where people would get heaps, and at the lower end where people actually get less."
200811,64,64320,190,NA,NA,· introducing national testing in schools – for no educational benefit
200811,64,64320,191,NA,NA,· further deregulation – as if no lesson had been learned from offshore experience.
200811,64,64320,192,NA,NA,· a broadband plan which favours the largest telco and is anti-competitive
200811,64,64320,193,NA,NA,· cuts to public spending – except on prisons where they want to build them for geriatrics they will never release.
200811,64,64320,194,NA,NA,Nobody could see that hopeless set of slogans as a road to recovery for New Zealand.
200811,64,64320,195,NA,NA,"In contrast, Labour offers vision and substance, backed by nine years of experience which equips us to face the current international crisis."
200811,64,64320,197,NA,NA,"· the challenge of terrorism – post September 11, and"
200811,64,64320,198,NA,NA,"· the challenge of climate change,"
200811,64,64320,199,NA,NA,"Now we will apply all the knowledge, skills, and judgement we have to leading New Zealand back to robust growth and government finances of the kind we have enjoyed under Labour before the current international crises struck."
200811,64,64320,200,NA,NA,"In the coming days, Michael Cullen will release more detail of our economic policy."
200811,64,64320,201,NA,NA,"He will focus primarily on the measures needed for long term growth,"
200811,64,64320,202,NA,NA,"but will also address some of the short term issues associated with the current crisis, such as measures to reduce the risk to companies concerned about their provisional tax commitments."
200811,64,64320,203,NA,NA,I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the phenomenal job Michael Cullen has done as both my deputy and as Minister of Finance these past nine years.
200811,64,64320,204,NA,NA,The fact that New Zealand is better placed than many nations during the current international crisis is due in no small part to his work as steward of our economy.
200811,64,64320,205,NA,NA,"Shortly I will release more policy initiatives for health and housing,"
200811,64,64320,206,NA,NA,and other policy will be released by ministers during the campaign.
200811,64,64320,207,NA,NA,But underpinning everything we will do is our focus on the future; on growth and investment;
200811,64,64320,208,NA,NA,"on opportunity,"
200811,64,64320,209,NA,NA,"security,"
200811,64,64320,210,NA,NA,and fairness.
200811,64,64320,211,NA,NA,We will take strong and decisive action to guarantee our future – as we always have.
200811,64,64320,212,NA,NA,Our vision for New Zealand is an inclusive one.
200811,64,64320,213,NA,NA,We seek reconciliation over the wrongs of the past
200811,64,64320,214,NA,NA,through the Treaty settlement process
200811,64,64320,215,NA,NA,and we seek to work with Maori as Treaty partners.
200811,64,64320,216,NA,NA,"We work hard for a 21st century New Zealand inclusive of all ethnicities, faiths, and beliefs."
200811,64,64320,217,NA,NA,We have a strong commitment to our nation’s natural heritage and we will act to protect and conserve it.
200811,64,64320,218,NA,NA,"Last week’s Crown acquisition of the 78,000 hectare St James pastoral lease near Hamner Springs has been a highlight for me."
200811,64,64320,219,NA,NA,That incredible area is now preserved for the people of New Zealand and our visitors to enjoy for all time.
200811,64,64320,220,NA,NA,We will continue our work to promote New Zealand’s unique culture and historical heritage
200811,64,64320,221,NA,NA,and the incredible talent of our creative people.
200811,64,64320,222,NA,NA,"As I speak new films are being made, music composed, and books written supported by the investments our Labour Government is prepared to make."
200811,64,64320,223,NA,NA,"In government over nine years, people have not always agreed with everything we have done."
200811,64,64320,225,NA,NA,· for getting things done
200811,64,64320,226,NA,NA,· for taking the tough decisions
200811,64,64320,227,NA,NA,· for sticking to our principles
200811,64,64320,228,NA,NA,· for not just saying whatever we think people want to hear
200811,64,64320,229,NA,NA,That is why I have said this election is about trust.
200811,64,64320,230,NA,NA,"Who do we trust the future of our family, our economy, our public services, and our country with?"
200811,64,64320,231,NA,NA,"Who has the experience, the judgement, the skills, and the contacts to lead New Zealand through challenging times?"
200811,64,64320,232,NA,NA,Leadership is about long term vision and commitment.

200811,64,64320,239,NA,NA,Labour represents Kiwis from every walk of life.
200811,64,64320,240,NA,NA,We know how important it is to be well connected because we know that public services work better when public organisations work closely with the real people they are working with.
200811,64,64320,241,NA,NA,One size definitely does not fit everyone.
200811,64,64320,242,NA,NA,Real people all have different needs.
200811,64,64320,243,NA,NA,We also have different needs at different stages of our lives.
200811,64,64320,244,NA,NA,But we deserve services that are designed for ‘us’ and are there to help us go about our lives.
200811,64,64320,245,NA,NA,Labour works for us all.
200811,64,64320,246,NA,NA,"So, whether that is working with older kiwis to understand their issues or working with Maori to make sure our young have access to the training and skills they need to do well or in a range of other ways, Labour will always ensure that everyone gets a fair go."
200811,64,64320,248,NA,NA,New Zealand is well positioned to ride out this challenging international economic period in a better shape than many other countries.
200811,64,64320,249,NA,NA,"That’s not because of luck, but because we have planned for it."
200811,64,64320,250,NA,NA,We have done what some said was impossible –

200811,64,64320,252,NA,NA,at the same time as we have invested in the future of all Kiwis.

200811,64,64320,254,NA,NA,We are a small proud and feisty island nation quite a long way from the rest of the world.

200811,64,64320,257,NA,NA,"and economic growth,"
200811,64,64320,258,NA,NA,we need to support forward-thinking Kiwi companies in their research and development
200811,64,64320,259,NA,NA,and help them to turn their ideas into sellable products.
200811,64,64320,260,NA,NA,We must also make sure we have the education and skills training necessary to contribute to and benefit from economic growth.
200811,64,64320,261,NA,NA,"By encouraging our businesses to become globally successful,"

200811,64,64320,266,NA,NA,"Screening is up, smoking is down and more of us are taking the driving seat in our own health."
200811,64,64320,267,NA,NA,Labour believes no one should have to choose between getting early health advice and putting food on the table
200811,64,64320,268,NA,NA,and that is why we have invested to halve the cost of seeing your GP and lower the price of prescriptions.
200811,64,64320,269,NA,NA,Labour believes our health system is a core part of kiwi life.
200811,64,64320,270,NA,NA,We don’t privatise this sort of necessity and have ambulance staff check our pockets for insurance cards before they act.

200811,64,64320,289,NA,NA,our sports people

200811,64,64320,292,NA,NA,"or our groundbraking free trade agreement with China,"

200811,64,64320,319,NA,NA,Likewise we need to preserve our international reputation as a country where human rights are upheld
200811,64,64320,320,NA,NA,and people are ‘safe’ from being exploited by institutions or individuals.
200811,64,64320,321,NA,NA,Labour will always invest to keep Kiwis safe across this broad spectrum.

200811,64,64320,340,NA,NA,"Increasingly first world consumers are making ethical decisions about what they will buy, based on the environmental integrity of a product – they want to know just what it does for them, they want to know how it was made, how was it produced, how did it get here."
200811,64,64320,341,NA,NA,"If we want to enjoy the best the world has to offer, we have to earn a global income."
200811,64,64320,342,NA,NA,And we must strengthen our clean and green Kiwi brand.
200811,64,64320,343,NA,NA,That is why the Emissions Trading Scheme is so important –
200811,64,64320,344,NA,NA,"it’s why the emphasis on renewable energy, and on energy efficiency, is so important,"
200811,64,64320,345,NA,NA,"and why we need to keep investing in public transport,"
200811,64,64320,346,NA,NA,cleaning up our water systems
200811,64,64320,347,NA,NA,and ensuring planning decisions continue to be made with an eye to the future and sustainability rather than just the short term.

200811,64,64620,12,NA,NA,"You're sick to death of hearing about Winston Peters,"
200811,64,64620,13,NA,NA,and you're sick of being told what to do.
200811,64,64620,14,NA,NA,You are looking for a Government that will focus on the issues that matter to you –
200811,64,64620,15,NA,NA,"a Government with a plan for economic recovery,"
200811,64,64620,16,NA,NA,and a Government with fresh ideas and the energy to meet the challenges this country faces.
200811,64,64620,17,NA,NA,At this election National is offering exactly that.
200811,64,64620,18,NA,NA,"I am campaigning on strengthening our economy,"
200811,64,64620,19,NA,NA,"on rising to the challenge presented by tough global conditions,"
200811,64,64620,20,NA,NA,and on delivering greater prosperity to New Zealanders
200811,64,64620,21,NA,NA,and their families –
200811,64,64620,22,NA,NA,"because Kiwis are sick of struggling to keep up with the cost of living,"
200811,64,64620,23,NA,NA,"they're sick of worrying about soaring interest rates,"
200811,64,64620,24,NA,NA,and they're sick of high taxes.
200811,64,64620,25,NA,NA,That's what Labour has delivered for nine years and that's what National is here to change.
200811,64,64620,26,NA,NA,"I am campaigning on raising education standards,"
200811,64,64620,27,NA,NA,"on running a crusade on literacy and numeracy,"
200811,64,64620,28,NA,NA,and on ensuring our schools are working for all students
200811,64,64620,29,NA,NA,"– because New Zealanders are sick of the long tail of underachievement in our schools,"
200811,64,64620,30,NA,NA,"they're sick of wondering how their children are really doing,"
200811,64,64620,31,NA,NA,and they're sick of yesterday's schools.
200811,64,64620,32,NA,NA,That's what Labour has delivered and that's what National is here to change.
200811,64,64620,33,NA,NA,"I'm campaigning on improving safety in our communities,"
200811,64,64620,34,NA,NA,"on cracking down on criminal gangs,"
200811,64,64620,35,NA,NA,"on going to war on P,"
200811,64,64620,36,NA,NA,and on getting dangerous criminals off our streets –
200811,64,64620,37,NA,NA,"because New Zealanders don't want LA-style gang crime,"
200811,64,64620,38,NA,NA,"they don't want spiralling youth crime,"
200811,64,64620,39,NA,NA,and they don't want dangerous criminals on our streets.
200811,64,64620,40,NA,NA,That's what Labour has delivered and that's what National is here to change.
200811,64,64620,41,NA,NA,"I'm campaigning on getting more out of our health system,"
200811,64,64620,42,NA,NA,"on delivering shorter waiting times,"
200811,64,64620,43,NA,NA,"on reducing bureaucracy,"
200811,64,64620,44,NA,NA,and on backing our doctors and nurses
200811,64,64620,45,NA,NA,"– because Labour has put in more of your money but they haven't got the results,"
200811,64,64620,46,NA,NA,and that's what National is here to change.
200811,64,64620,48,NA,NA,"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is no ordinary election campaign."
200811,64,64620,49,NA,NA,Because this election comes at a time when the global economy is in turmoil and at a time when we are all concerned about what the future may contain.
200811,64,64620,50,NA,NA,"Unlike Labour, I'm not prepared to mislead the New Zealand public about the situation this country finds itself in."
200811,64,64620,51,NA,NA,I understand how tough times already are for many of you.
200811,64,64620,52,NA,NA,"I also understand that the events we've been seeing on our news bulletins each night – the diving sharemarkets, the bank bailouts, the collapsing firms – though seemingly far away, have and will continue to have real implications for many New Zealanders."
200811,64,64620,53,NA,NA,I won't continue Helen Clark's business-as-usual farce.
200811,64,64620,54,NA,NA,A National Government will rise to these challenges.
200811,64,64620,55,NA,NA,"We have been monitoring the build-up in problems in the financial markets over the past several months, and particularly in recent weeks, and the scale of intervention by other governments."
200811,64,64620,56,NA,NA,"We have kept in close contact with the Reserve Bank, and I am satisfied that its current plans are sufficient at this stage to maintain confidence in the New Zealand financial system over the coming months."
200811,64,64620,57,NA,NA,"Should it become necessary, however, National is committed to working with the Reserve Bank to ensure financial stability."
200811,64,64620,58,NA,NA,We will do what needs to be done to keep our financial system strong.
200811,64,64620,59,NA,NA,But I'm also here to tell you that something has to change.
200811,64,64620,60,NA,NA,Because Labour doesn't have what it takes to get us through this one.
200811,64,64620,61,NA,NA,They have ignored the evolving economic crisis and they have done so at your peril.
200811,64,64620,62,NA,NA,Getting through this storm will require an astute and economically focused Government.
200811,64,64620,63,NA,NA,Labour simply isn't up to the task.
200811,64,64620,64,NA,NA,They are fair-weather economic managers.
200811,64,64620,65,NA,NA,They know how to spend your money and play with a surplus.
200811,64,64620,66,NA,NA,But they don't know how to boost economic growth
200811,64,64620,67,NA,NA,and get value for your money.
200811,64,64620,68,NA,NA,"Today, somewhere else in Auckland, they're launching a campaign for re-election."
200811,64,64620,69,NA,NA,They'll be talking about economic transformation and listing a whole bunch of buzzwords.
200811,64,64620,70,NA,NA,Well you know what?
200811,64,64620,71,NA,NA,Labour's actions speak louder than their slogans.
200811,64,64620,72,NA,NA,Because Labour had nine years of great global conditions.
200811,64,64620,73,NA,NA,Ask yourself this: Do you really feel better off?
200811,64,64620,74,NA,NA,• You had nine years without a tax cut.
200811,64,64620,75,NA,NA,• Interest rates doubled.
200811,64,64620,76,NA,NA,• Inflation went through the roof.
200811,64,64620,77,NA,NA,• The wage gap with Australia widened.
200811,64,64620,78,NA,NA,• And more of your friends and family have left this country permanently.
200811,64,64620,79,NA,NA,"It's a shocking record, and Helen Clark and Michael Cullen should be judged by it."
200811,64,64620,80,NA,NA,"Warren Buffett has a saying that, 'You never know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out'."
200811,64,64620,81,NA,NA,"Labour managed to disguise their loose economic management in the good times, but now that the tide is out they are awfully exposed."
200811,64,64620,82,NA,NA,"When Michael Cullen opened the books last week, what was his news for struggling Kiwis?"
200811,64,64620,83,NA,NA,A decade of deficits.
200811,64,64620,84,NA,NA,A decade of deficits and what's he planning to change?
200811,64,64620,85,NA,NA,Absolutely nothing.
200811,64,64620,86,NA,NA,"Worse than that, he revealed almost 60 fiscal risks – extra spending promises to add to the red ink."
200811,64,64620,87,NA,NA,"Well, I'm here to tell you that Michael Cullen's number just came up."
200811,64,64620,88,NA,NA,And he signed his valedictory in red ink.
200811,64,64620,89,NA,NA,Because New Zealand can't afford our fair-weather Finance Minister any longer.
200811,64,64620,90,NA,NA,Only National will show the discipline and resolve needed to ensure Kiwis can have financial security in the years ahead.
200811,64,64620,91,NA,NA,Only National can make the most out of every taxpayer dollar.
200811,64,64620,92,NA,NA,And only National can get New Zealand out of the red ink.
200811,64,64620,94,NA,NA,"Earlier this week, while Helen Clark was announcing another business-as-usual purchase of a $40 million estate for DOC, I released National's economic management plan."
200811,64,64620,95,NA,NA,"It's a plan to bring discipline to government spending,"
200811,64,64620,96,NA,NA,"to reduce red tape,"
200811,64,64620,97,NA,NA,"to reduce personal taxes,"
200811,64,64620,98,NA,NA,"to boost infrastructure investment,"
200811,64,64620,99,NA,NA,and to raise education standards.
200811,64,64620,100,NA,NA,It's a recovery plan to ensure our country and our families get through these tough times.
200811,64,64620,101,NA,NA,Some say it has not done enough.
200811,64,64620,102,NA,NA,Some say it does too much.
200811,64,64620,103,NA,NA,Some say we should have cancelled all tax cuts and battened down the hatches.
200811,64,64620,104,NA,NA,I've got a few points to make about it.
200811,64,64620,105,NA,NA,"First, let me be clear: National's tax reductions on April 1 next year will come right when our economy needs them."
200811,64,64620,106,NA,NA,It would be absolutely wrong to tighten the screws on the economy at this point.
200811,64,64620,107,NA,NA,It would cost people jobs and it would grind our economic engine to a halt.
200811,64,64620,108,NA,NA,What our country actually needs is a boost.
200811,64,64620,109,NA,NA,Reducing taxes will stimulate the economy and that is what we will sorely need by April next year.
200811,64,64620,110,NA,NA,"Second, National's plan faces the fact that we must lift productivity in this country."
200811,64,64620,111,NA,NA,Labour has a dreadful record on productivity and National will do better.
200811,64,64620,112,NA,NA,That starts by sorting out the Beehive's own backyard and getting some productivity improvements in the public sector
200811,64,64620,113,NA,NA,"– reducing administration costs,"
200811,64,64620,114,NA,NA,"cutting red tape,"
200811,64,64620,115,NA,NA,pushing money into frontline services.
200811,64,64620,116,NA,NA,"We will do that, Labour won't do that."
200811,64,64620,117,NA,NA,End of story.
200811,64,64620,118,NA,NA,"Third, National's plan recognises that lifting productivity also means removing the bottlenecks in the economy – the roading problems and the creaky communications networks that are holding business back."
200811,64,64620,119,NA,NA,That's why National will fix the Resource Management Act
200811,64,64620,120,NA,NA,and that's why we'll invest more in the infrastructure the economy needs to grow.
200811,64,64620,121,NA,NA,"Fourth, lifting productivity also means encouraging businesses to invest."
200811,64,64620,122,NA,NA,The guys in red like to talk about this idea.
200811,64,64620,123,NA,NA,But let me tell you something.
200811,64,64620,124,NA,NA,I've had a bit more to do with business than them
200811,64,64620,125,NA,NA,and it's actually more straightforward than they think.
200811,64,64620,126,NA,NA,The number 1 reason that private companies invest is because they are profitable and feeling positive about the future.
200811,64,64620,127,NA,NA,All the R&D credits in the world won't cut it if companies aren't making any money.
200811,64,64620,128,NA,NA,We have to get the fundamentals right first.
200811,64,64620,129,NA,NA,"Finally, a Government that cares about the future of our children and our grandchildren simply must have a plan for digging us out of deficit."
200811,64,64620,130,NA,NA,That's what National's plan will do.
200811,64,64620,131,NA,NA,It won't be an easy task.
200811,64,64620,132,NA,NA,So it's no surprise that Labour has nothing to say on this one.
200811,64,64620,133,NA,NA,Only National has the backbone needed to deliver for our children and dig this country out of deficit.
200811,64,64620,134,NA,NA,But there is no free lunch.
200811,64,64620,135,NA,NA,The road out of deficit involves making some hard choices.
200811,64,64620,136,NA,NA,And we've done that.
200811,64,64620,137,NA,NA,"We've been straight-up and said that in its current form, Labour's gold-plated KiwiSaver scheme isn't affordable."
200811,64,64620,138,NA,NA,"It's not affordable for the three out of four working-aged Kiwis who haven't joined,"
200811,64,64620,139,NA,NA,and it's not affordable for the Kiwi taxpayer.
200811,64,64620,140,NA,NA,"National's plan will get us more quickly out of deficit, but not yet as quickly as I would like."
200811,64,64620,141,NA,NA,If we're to get New Zealand out of deficit before this year's new entrants go to secondary school then we must grow our economy faster.
200811,64,64620,142,NA,NA,I know we can do it.
200811,64,64620,143,NA,NA,You want to know why?
200811,64,64620,144,NA,NA,Because I've actually worked in the world of finance and business.
200811,64,64620,145,NA,NA,Helen Clark hasn't.
200811,64,64620,146,NA,NA,I've actually picked up a struggling business and made it grow.
200811,64,64620,147,NA,NA,Helen Clark never has.
200811,64,64620,148,NA,NA,"And I've actually got stuck into a business, trimmed its sails, and delivered some profits to its shareholders."
200811,64,64620,149,NA,NA,And that's what I am determined to do for this country.
200811,64,64620,151,NA,NA,"In laying out our economic plan, National has been very clear about our priorities."
200811,64,64620,152,NA,NA,"We all know what will be the first to go under Labour, whether they want to admit it or not, and that is the rest of their tax-cut package."
200811,64,64620,153,NA,NA,"Well, unlike Labour I'm going to be straight-up about my priorities."
200811,64,64620,154,NA,NA,That's why I'm sending a card to all of you.
200811,64,64620,155,NA,NA,It's called My Key Commitments to You and it will be delivered to every household in New Zealand over the next 10 days.
200811,64,64620,156,NA,NA,In it are 11 commitments that I make to you.
200811,64,64620,157,NA,NA,Some people might suggest it's similar to the pledge card Helen Clark has previously released.
200811,64,64620,158,NA,NA,"Well, there are several differences, but let me tell you the really big difference."
200811,64,64620,159,NA,NA,This one is not paid for by taxpayers.
200811,64,64620,160,NA,NA,Our commitment card is proudly paid for by supporters of the National Party.
200811,64,64620,161,NA,NA,"Unlike Helen Clark, we're not breaking the law to make someone else pay for it."
200811,64,64620,162,NA,NA,Let me tell you what it says.
200811,64,64620,163,NA,NA,"If National is elected to lead the next Government, I personally guarantee we will deliver on the following 11 key commitments."
200811,64,64620,164,NA,NA,"Number 1, we will strengthen the economy,"
200811,64,64620,165,NA,NA,"increase after-tax incomes,"
200811,64,64620,166,NA,NA,"and ensure Kiwis can get ahead under their own steam by reducing personal taxes on 1 April 2009, 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011."
200811,64,64620,167,NA,NA,Under National you won't have to wait nine years for tax reduction.
200811,64,64620,168,NA,NA,"We will deliver tax reduction five months from now, on 1 April 2009."
200811,64,64620,169,NA,NA,And unlike Labour we won't cancel our tax cuts.
200811,64,64620,170,NA,NA,We'll get New Zealand through this recession and on to a growth path.
200811,64,64620,171,NA,NA,"Number 2, we will maintain and build New Zealand's asset base by increasing investment in infrastructure such as roads, broadband, and public transport,"
200811,64,64620,172,NA,NA,and by not selling Kiwibank or any other state-owned company.
200811,64,64620,173,NA,NA,I'm not interested in selling assets – I'm all about building assets.
200811,64,64620,174,NA,NA,We need to unblock the bottlenecks in New Zealand's economy.
200811,64,64620,175,NA,NA,We need to make sure there aren't barriers in the way of productive growth.
200811,64,64620,176,NA,NA,We need to invest in the breakthrough technology that will get us up to speed with the rest of the world.
200811,64,64620,177,NA,NA,"Number 3, we will ensure government spending is focused on frontline services such as health and education by capping the number of bureaucrats"
200811,64,64620,178,NA,NA,and putting real discipline around government spending.
200811,64,64620,179,NA,NA,"If I am elected Prime Minister of this country on November 8, I will bring the chief executives of government departments together and give them a simple message: Your mission is to facilitate the development of a more successful, prosperous nation"
200811,64,64620,180,NA,NA,– not to stand in the way of those who seek to create that prosperity.
200811,64,64620,181,NA,NA,And my message to government employees will be just as clear: You must focus taxpayers' money on the frontline services that New Zealanders have a right to expect.
200811,64,64620,182,NA,NA,And you must scrutinise every dollar to make sure it is money well spent.
200811,64,64620,183,NA,NA,Labour has been a fair-weather Government in rosy economic times.
200811,64,64620,184,NA,NA,Labour is used to being awash with cash and being able to waste your money.
200811,64,64620,185,NA,NA,"Well, the surpluses are now all gone."
200811,64,64620,186,NA,NA,It's time for a National Government that will get the most out of every single dollar.
200811,64,64620,187,NA,NA,"Number 4, we will make our communities safer by ensuring the worst repeat violent offenders are not eligible for parole."
200811,64,64620,188,NA,NA,"This week, an editorial in the New Zealand Herald suggested National won't follow through on this policy."
200811,64,64620,189,NA,NA,"Well, I've got news for them."
200811,64,64620,190,NA,NA,I am 100% committed to this policy and
200811,64,64620,191,NA,NA,I will see that it is delivered.
200811,64,64620,192,NA,NA,Because parole is a privilege not a right.
200811,64,64620,193,NA,NA,Some people say that's not fair on criminals.
200811,64,64620,194,NA,NA,"Well, on this question, as on all law and order questions, I'm prepared to take a side."
200811,64,64620,195,NA,NA,And that side is the side of law-abiding New Zealanders.
200811,64,64620,196,NA,NA,You have had to put up with escalating violent crime for too long.
200811,64,64620,197,NA,NA,I'm determined to get on top of it.
200811,64,64620,198,NA,NA,"Number 5, we will confront failure in our school system by setting National Standards in literacy and numeracy, requiring every pupil's progress to be assessed and the results reported to parents in plain English."
200811,64,64620,199,NA,NA,I was able to get where I am today because I received a good education.
200811,64,64620,200,NA,NA,"Today, one in five children is leaving school without the qualifications and skills they need to succeed."
200811,64,64620,201,NA,NA,Those kids are New Zealand's future.
200811,64,64620,202,NA,NA,We're going to tackle their literacy and numeracy problems early.
200811,64,64620,203,NA,NA,We'll make sure parents know how their child is really doing.
200811,64,64620,204,NA,NA,And we'll make sure teachers work with struggling kids to get them up to standard.
200811,64,64620,205,NA,NA,It's time to put the rungs back on the ladder of opportunity.
200811,64,64620,206,NA,NA,"Number 6, we will tackle our health workforce crisis by introducing voluntary bonding for new doctors, nurses, and midwives,"

201111,64,64420,48,NA,NA,"We in the ACT Party are in no doubt at all about which of these two men offers the better prospect for our great country, and we have already declared publicly that we will give Confidence and Supply to a John Key-led Government."
201111,64,64420,49,NA,NA,The Labour Party is advocating policies which nobody who cares for our long-term future could support
201111,64,64420,50,NA,NA,– massively more borrowing than even National proposes;
201111,64,64420,51,NA,NA,employment legislation which would see a  return to the industrial mayhem which prevailed before 1991;
201111,64,64420,52,NA,NA,a $15 minimum wage which would lead quite directly to more unemployment;
201111,64,64420,53,NA,NA,an end to the 90-day trial period in employment contracts;
201111,64,64420,54,NA,NA,a capital gains tax;
201111,64,64420,55,NA,NA,a big increase in the compliance costs imposed on small businesses because of the exemption of fruit and vegetables from GST;
201111,64,64420,56,NA,NA,a huge increase in the costs of the farming sector as a result of bringing biological emissions into the ETS in 2013;
201111,64,64420,57,NA,NA,and an instruction to the Reserve Bank to stop worrying about inflation and start focusing on the exchange rate.
201111,64,64420,58,NA,NA,  This is crazy stuff.
201111,64,64420,59,NA,NA,"As an aside, I understand as well as anybody the problem which big swings in the exchange rate cause for exporters."
201111,64,64420,60,NA,NA,  I spent almost 14 years of my life trying to reduce those big swings.
201111,64,64420,61,NA,NA,"  Alas, there are no easy ways to eliminate them, not at least if keeping inflation under control is also an objective. "
201111,64,64420,62,NA,NA,"The Labour Party pretended they knew what to do about this issue in 1999, when they were campaigning to win the election in that year, and promised to have the whole Reserve Bank framework put under a microscope."
201111,64,64420,63,NA,NA,"  When they won the election, they duly appointed a monetary policy expert from Sweden to do exactly that, and after months of study, the expert declared the New Zealand monetary policy framework world’s best practice."
201111,64,64420,64,NA,NA,"It may sound good to exporters for Labour to say that they will smooth out those exchange rate fluctuations and keep inflation under control: believe me, no central bank has yet discovered how to do that."
201111,64,64420,65,NA,NA,So there’s not the slightest chance that ACT could support Labour after the election.
201111,64,64420,66,NA,NA,"But like many others, we want a John Key-led Government to deal more decisively with the challenges which our country faces than has been the case over the last three years."
201111,64,64420,67,NA,NA,"The Government has introduced National Standards in the school system, and some of our schools are world class."
201111,64,64420,68,NA,NA,  But far too many young people are coming out of 10 or 12 years of school barely literate. 
201111,64,64420,69,NA,NA,"Parents who scrimp and save to send their children to independent schools are forced to pay twice for the privilege, once through taxation and a second time through school fees."
201111,64,64420,70,NA,NA,"  The school system remains highly centralised – with a centralised curriculum, and a centralised and bureaucratic remuneration system."
201111,64,64420,71,NA,NA,"There has been a pleasing reduction in violent crime in the last three years, and the ACT Party can take some of the credit for that"
201111,64,64420,72,NA,NA,"– we supported National in increasing police numbers, especially in South Auckland,"
201111,64,64420,73,NA,NA,"and we were responsible for getting the Three Strikes legislation passed, so that repeat violent and sexual offenders spend longer in jail. "
201111,64,64420,74,NA,NA,"But there is still far too much senseless violence,"
201111,64,64420,75,NA,NA,"and too often the police prosecute the victim of that crime, as when Virender Singh was prosecuted a year or so ago when he tried to defend himself with a hockey stick while being attacked by five drunken youths."
201111,64,64420,76,NA,NA,"Right now, the world economy is looking more ominous than at any time in my life-time.  "
201111,64,64420,77,NA,NA,I spent a few days visiting London and Washington late last month to get a first-hand picture of just how bad things might get.
201111,64,64420,78,NA,NA,  I came home deeply worried – the Eurozone is in serious trouble because of irresponsible government spending in the countries of southern Europe; the United Kingdom and the United States are struggling under massive government deficits; and Japan seems unable to get to grips with its own massive government debt.
201111,64,64420,79,NA,NA,  The scope for the world economy to endure a prolonged and deep recession is all too evident.
201111,64,64420,80,NA,NA,"In this threatening global environment, we believe the Government needs to urgently focus its spending on those who most need it,"
201111,64,64420,81,NA,NA,"to flatten and reduce taxes in order to encourage investment,"
201111,64,64420,82,NA,NA,"and to radically reduce the bureaucracy which makes life so miserable for homeowners, farmers, and manufacturers – indeed, for anybody wanting to do something!"
201111,64,64420,83,NA,NA,"Realistically, ACT is the only party which can help National do what John Key and the rest of the Cabinet know needs to be done."
201111,64,64420,84,NA,NA,  And Friday’s “cup of tea” shows clearly that John Key knows that.
201111,64,64420,85,NA,NA,"Over the last three years, ACT has ensured stable centre-right government – indeed, we enabled John Key to announce that he was in a position to form a government on the night of the last election, because we had pledged support to National in advance, as we have done again."
201111,64,64420,86,NA,NA,"Again and again, we supported National Party-initiated legislation when without our support legislation would have failed."
201111,64,64420,87,NA,NA,"We gave voice to widespread public concern about the Anti-Smacking law,"
201111,64,64420,88,NA,NA,"the Marine and Coastal Area Act,"
201111,64,64420,89,NA,NA,"and the Emissions Trading Scheme, though ultimately in vain."
201111,64,64420,90,NA,NA,We can claim much of the credit for the retention of the right to silence in criminal cases.
201111,64,64420,91,NA,NA,"And as I’ve mentioned, as a result of our initiative, the Three Strikes legislation was passed."
201111,64,64420,92,NA,NA,"  As a result of our initiative, students are no longer obliged to join a union."
201111,64,64420,93,NA,NA,"  As a result of our initiative, the Productivity Commission was set up."
201111,64,64420,94,NA,NA,"  As a result of our initiative, the 2025 Taskforce was set up, and the National Party committed to promoting policies which would close the income gap with Australia by 2025."
201111,64,64420,95,NA,NA,"   (National doesn’t talk about closing that gap much anymore, because they know they don’t have a plan to close it. "
201111,64,64420,96,NA,NA,ACT does!)
201111,64,64420,97,NA,NA,"So we’ve shown we can work with National, and can deliver positive benefits for New Zealand."
201111,64,64420,98,NA,NA,But much remains to be done.
201111,64,64420,99,NA,NA,"In the last few weeks, National has gone some way towards policies which we strongly support by proposing quite far-reaching welfare reform,"
201111,64,64420,100,NA,NA,"some useful changes in employment law, and some steps in the right direction in enabling employers to take on teenagers at less than the adult minimum wage."
201111,64,64420,101,NA,NA,  They’ve even made some tentative suggestions for reforming the Resource Management Act.
201111,64,64420,102,NA,NA,  We support all these moves – as far as they go.
201111,64,64420,103,NA,NA,But let me set out what we would like to achieve in the next Parliament. 
201111,64,64420,104,NA,NA,"There are nine policy areas we’ll be looking to work with National on to improve the lives of all New Zealanders, and perhaps especially those New Zealanders whom the major parties seem to have forgotten – those who struggle to keep small and entrepreneurial businesses alive,"
201111,64,64420,105,NA,NA,"the farmers and those who provide services in rural communities,"
201111,64,64420,106,NA,NA,"the self-employed taxi drivers and dairy owners (for whom earning even $13 an hour for the hours worked seems a distant dream),"
201111,64,64420,107,NA,NA,those struggling to cope with the burden of bureaucratic officials and senseless red-tape.
201111,64,64420,109,NA,NA,"1)    First, we want to ensure that the two Bills introduced by Rodney Hide in the last Parliament are passed into law – namely the Spending Cap (People’s Veto) Bill and the Regulatory Standards Bill."
201111,64,64420,110,NA,NA,"The Spending Cap Bill would not require any reduction in government spending – indeed, it would explicitly allow government spending to increase as our population grows and as prices rise, and it would allow for a complete exemption from the cap to deal with a national emergency, such as the Christchurch earthquakes –"
201111,64,64420,111,NA,NA,but it would prevent future governments engaging in the kind of grossly irresponsible electoral bribes which the Clark Government undertook in the last three years of that Government’s life.
201111,64,64420,112,NA,NA,"  For this reason, we believe its passage is well overdue."
201111,64,64420,113,NA,NA,"Similarly, the Regulatory Standards Bill – opposed by most government departments and supported by most people in the private sector – would raise the bar on new legislation and regulation to the considerable benefit of everybody."
201111,64,64420,114,NA,NA,Only a party vote for ACT will get these two fundamentally important pieces of legislation passed into law!
201111,64,64420,116,NA,NA,"2)    Second, we will be pushing for a faster reduction in government spending – relative to the size of the economy – than that currently envisaged."
201111,64,64420,117,NA,NA,"  At the moment, government spending is a larger share of the total economy than in any year of the last Labour Government."
201111,64,64420,118,NA,NA,  And yet there are a number of spending programmes which National criticised strongly when in Opposition but which remain untouched –
201111,64,64420,119,NA,NA,programmes which have little or no merit in terms of any concept of social justice.
201111,64,64420,120,NA,NA,Getting spending under control more quickly would have three important benefits.
201111,64,64420,121,NA,NA,It would hasten the day when we’re no longer borrowing from our children to make life more enjoyable for ourselves.
201111,64,64420,122,NA,NA,It would enable tax rates to be reduced and flattened.
201111,64,64420,123,NA,NA,  We’re especially keen to get the company tax rate reduced – that’s vitally important if we’re to see a strong increase in investment in New Zealand.
201111,64,64420,124,NA,NA,"  Yes, our company tax rate was reduced last year, but taken together with the change in depreciation allowances the overall effect was to increase the effective corporate tax rate."
201111,64,64420,125,NA,NA,"  In any event, our company tax rate remains at 28%."
201111,64,64420,126,NA,NA,  That in fast-growing Singapore and Hong Kong is only 17%.
201111,64,64420,127,NA,NA,By how much could tax rates be reduced?
201111,64,64420,128,NA,NA,"  The 2025 Taskforce showed that, if government spending could be reduced to the same share of GDP that it was in 2005, at the end of Labour’s second three-year term in office, then the top personal tax rate and the company tax rate could both be reduced to 20%."
201111,64,64420,129,NA,NA,"  I’m not confident that that’s still possible, but a radical reduction of both rates could certainly be achieved."
201111,64,64420,130,NA,NA,"Because of the crucial need to raise wages and salaries by increasing investment, we favour accepting that there will need to be an ongoing gap between the company rate and the top personal rate (as there is currently) by introducing a radically lower company tax rate at 12.5%, with the top personal rate as low as revenue will allow, perhaps 25%."
201111,64,64420,131,NA,NA,"  We don’t doubt that that would have a very dramatic effect on investment, and therefore on wages, salaries and jobs."
201111,64,64420,132,NA,NA,Another substantial benefit of getting government spending reduced more quickly is that it would help reduce the exchange rate
201111,64,64420,133,NA,NA, – vitally important if farmers and other exporters are to generate the strong growth in exports that our high level of overseas debt demands.
201111,64,64420,134,NA,NA,This is partly because much of the borrowing being undertaken by the government is being done by selling bonds to foreigners – and of course those foreigners have to buy New Zealand dollars to buy the government bonds.
201111,64,64420,135,NA,NA,"It’s also partly because tighter restraint on government spending would almost inevitably prompt the Reserve Bank to further reduce the Official Cash Rate, and that too would reduce the upward pressure on the exchange rate."
201111,64,64420,136,NA,NA,"  Yes, the OCR is lower now than at any time in our history, but it’s also higher than in any other developed country except Australia."
201111,64,64420,137,NA,NA,"  There can’t be much doubt that if the OCR were, say, 1% rather than 2.5%, the exchange rate would be lower and export growth would be stronger."
201111,64,64420,138,NA,NA,"Only a party vote for ACT will get government spending back under control quickly, and take the pressure off exporters!"
201111,64,64420,140,NA,NA,"3)    Third, we will be pushing for a strong attack on bureaucracy."
201111,64,64420,141,NA,NA,"  And by that we don’t simply mean a reduction in the number of bureaucrats, though that would no doubt be part of it."
201111,64,64420,142,NA,NA,  We mean taking an axe to some of the more ridiculous rules and regulations which those bureaucrats enforce:
201111,64,64420,143,NA,NA,· The rule which enables Auckland Council planners to tell a home-owner to paint her white house black or brown because it’s near the Kaipara;
201111,64,64420,144,NA,NA,· The rule which requires a retailer of farming equipment in Masterton to get approval before erecting a sign on his own property;

201111,64,64420,149,NA,NA,"Fixing these frustrating and expensive rules would almost certainly require a fundamental reform of both the RMA and the Local Government Act, and quite possibly an amendment to the Bill of Rights Act to ensure that the right to peaceful enjoyment of one’s own property is enshrined in law."
201111,64,64420,150,NA,NA,Only a party vote for ACT will make a serious dent in the inane bureaucratic rules which cost us a fortune and ruin our lives!

201111,64,64420,153,NA,NA,"  Whatever you believe about the causes of climate change, it makes no sense at all for New Zealand, producing just 0.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, to have the only all sectors, all gasses, ETS in the world."
201111,64,64420,154,NA,NA,"No other country penalises farming for its production of greenhouse gases, and yet that is a major part of the ETS in New Zealand."

201111,64,64420,156,NA,NA,"But even now agriculture is hurt by the effect of the ETS on the price of electricity, petrol, diesel, and coal."
201111,64,64420,157,NA,NA,"  If biological emissions were to be included in the ETS on the basis proposed by the Labour Party, it would have an absolutely devastating effect on the viability of a great many farms."
201111,64,64420,158,NA,NA,  Even the deferment proposed by the National Party would at best leave farmers paying thousands of dollars for their use of on- and off-farm energy.
201111,64,64420,159,NA,NA,  New Zealand’s farming sector – the most efficient producer of food in the world – doesn’t deserve that kind of punishment.
201111,64,64420,160,NA,NA,"Indeed, there’s a strong argument that biological emissions don’t add to greenhouse gases at all: every unit of carbon emitted by pastures, crops and animals was first absorbed from the atmosphere."
201111,64,64420,161,NA,NA,Only a party vote for ACT can protect farmers – and the rest of us – from the ETS!
201111,64,64420,163,NA,NA,"5)    Fifth, we want taxpayer funding to “follow the child”, to give parents an opportunity to send their children to any school willing to take them, as already happens with Early Childhood Education."
201111,64,64420,164,NA,NA,"  This would enable parents to send their child to an independent school if that was their preference, or to an “integrated school”. "
201111,64,64420,165,NA,NA,"And to enable parents to make an informed choice about which school is best suited to their child, we would open up SchoolSMART, a website run by the Ministry of Education which holds information about schools, about pupils’ performance, about teacher performance and about other indicators."

201111,64,64420,167,NA,NA,"In Government, they haven’t done it."
201111,64,64420,168,NA,NA,"We would recognise long-established and well run state schools, such as Auckland Grammar, Epsom Girls, McLean’s College, Rangitoto College, Wellington College and Christchurch Boys High School, as “trust schools”, and allow them to operate substantially free from bureaucratic control – including giving them the ability to establish other campuses, perhaps by acquiring schools which might be losing pupils."

201111,64,64420,178,NA,NA,"But whether by 2023 or 2033, this issue needs to be put on the agenda."
201111,64,64420,179,NA,NA,"  Most other developed countries are gradually increasing the age at which their citizens become eligible for taxpayer-funded retirement income, and for the same reason."

201111,64,64420,181,NA,NA,  It’s totally irresponsible to pretend that no increase will be needed.
201111,64,64420,182,NA,NA,Only a party vote for ACT will ensure that this issue is addressed in a timely way!

201111,64,64420,185,NA,NA,and ensuring that young offenders are appropriately dealt with before their criminal activities escalate.
201111,64,64420,186,NA,NA,The statute books already entitle people to use reasonable force to defend themselves and their property.
201111,64,64420,187,NA,NA,"  But in practice it’s all too common for the police to charge people who defend themselves – in other words, for the police to treat victims as criminals."
201111,64,64420,188,NA,NA,I mentioned the case of Virender Singh a moment ago.
201111,64,64420,189,NA,NA,"  I could have mentioned the case of Greg Carvell, charged with shooting and wounding an intruder who was threatening him and two of his staff with a machete."

201111,64,64420,191,NA,NA,  There have been far too many similar cases.
201111,64,64420,192,NA,NA,While clearly the use of force in defence of person and property must be reasonable – it would clearly be absurd to use lethal force against a teenager retrieving a ball from your front lawn – the present policy needs to change.
201111,64,64420,193,NA,NA, We believe there’d be merit in enshrining the right to self-defence in the Bill of Rights Act.
201111,64,64420,194,NA,NA,"In respect of youth offending, there’s a lot of evidence that to the extent young people get away with minor offending, there’s an increased chance of their engaging in further and more serious offending."

201111,64,64420,202,NA,NA,8)    Our eighth agenda item is to give effective force to Article III of the Treaty of Waitangi – the clause which asserts that all New Zealanders have equal status at law.
201111,64,64420,203,NA,NA,  We reject the notion that the Treaty established a “partnership” between “the Crown” (on behalf of all New Zealanders) and a subset of New Zealanders defined by their ancestry.
201111,64,64420,204,NA,NA,"  If Article III is taken seriously, it leaves no room for separate Maori electorates in Parliament,"
201111,64,64420,205,NA,NA,"no room for Maori wards in local government,"
201111,64,64420,206,NA,NA,and no room for requiring consultation with Maori over and above the obligation to consult with any other New Zealander.
201111,64,64420,207,NA,NA,"We believe that, except where already in private ownership, the foreshore and seabed should belong to the Crown, on behalf of all New Zealanders."
201111,64,64420,208,NA,NA,"  Because we are a party which believes in the rule of law, and in particular the right of all New Zealanders to have access to the courts, we also believe that those who think they have a customary right to certain parts of the foreshore should be allowed to have their claims tested in court."
201111,64,64420,209,NA,NA,"  And we mean tested in court: we don’t regard negotiating such claims with a minister, within an intensely political environment where Parliamentary votes are at stake, as at all a substitute."
201111,64,64420,210,NA,NA,"We favour the enactment of a simple piece of legislation providing that nothing in any statute or regulation, whether passed by Parliament or by any other regulation-making body, should confer any benefit, preferment or special status on anybody by reason of the ethnicity of that person."

201111,64,64420,216,NA,NA,  We have supported the Government in its determination to fulfill New Zealand’s commitments in Afghanistan until next April.
201111,64,64420,217,NA,NA,"  We continue to regard a close relationship with Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada as fundamental to our security."
201111,64,64420,218,NA,NA,"But we’ve come to the conclusion after extensive talks with Fijians now living in New Zealand, and New Zealanders with long experience in the Pacific, that our present policy of holding the Bainimarama regime at arm’s length is not working for New Zealand or for Fiji."
201111,64,64420,219,NA,NA,Fiji has long been family: many New Zealanders holiday there and a significant number have business interests there.
201111,64,64420,220,NA,NA,  Many New Zealanders were born there. 
201111,64,64420,221,NA,NA,We need to rebuild a positive relationship with that country
201111,64,64420,222,NA,NA,"– encouraging the regime towards its professed aim of building a vibrant colour-blind democracy, based on one vote one person."
201111,64,64420,223,NA,NA,Only a party vote for ACT will lead to a re-examination of our relationship with Fiji!
201111,64,64420,224,NA,NA,So there you have a summary statement – the ACT Plan for the next Parliamentary term if you like – setting out what we will be aiming to achieve in the next Parliament.
201111,64,64420,225,NA,NA,"All of our policies are motivated by a concern for those New Zealanders who, like Adrian and Jules Paalvast, want to return to their homeland, but feel that they can’t do so in fairness to their children."
201111,64,64420,226,NA,NA,"  And for those who still live in New Zealand but feel deeply torn between what this country has to offer and the much higher living standard which, for the foreseeable future, they could enjoy abroad."
201111,64,64420,227,NA,NA,"And when we look at the policy positions being adopted by other potential partners of the National Party, we’re convinced that ACT is the most logical partner for National."
201111,64,64420,228,NA,NA,"The parties of the left – Labour, Mana, Maori and Green parties – are in a competition over who can come up with the most economically irrational policies."
201111,64,64420,229,NA,NA,"  They are in a race to increase the minimum wage – in the process, destroying jobs and consigning those they claim to represent to the unemployment benefit."
201111,64,64420,230,NA,NA,  So much for compassion!
201111,64,64420,231,NA,NA,Their other policies would be just as destructive. 
201111,64,64420,232,NA,NA,"The Maori Party wants to exempt the first $25,000 of income from tax;"
201111,64,64420,233,NA,NA,to make teaching te reo compulsory in secondary schools;

201111,64,64420,235,NA,NA,to write Treaty of Waitangi principles (whatever they are!) into employment law;
201111,64,64420,236,NA,NA,and to give iwi a veto over foreign investment.
201111,64,64420,237,NA,NA,"The Green Party wants to protect the environment, as of course we in ACT do also,"
201111,64,64420,238,NA,NA,but has a totally unworldly view of how economies work and has no understanding what a devastating impact on our living standards the implementation of their core policy platform would have.
201111,64,64420,239,NA,NA,"  For a party that talks up their opposition to big business, they seem intent on delivering massive subsidies to big businesses that promise to create so-called “green jobs” – despite policies of that kind leading to massive job losses in countries such as Spain which have gone down that path."
201111,64,64420,240,NA,NA,"By contrast, ACT shares much the same basic philosophy as the National Party – a belief in freedom,"
201111,64,64420,241,NA,NA,"in individual responsibility,"
201111,64,64420,242,NA,NA,"in limited government,"
201111,64,64420,243,NA,NA,"in equal citizenship,"
201111,64,64420,244,NA,NA,"a belief that New Zealanders’ lives would be better by having less government – less government taxation, less government spending, less government borrowing, less government bureaucracy."
201111,64,64420,245,NA,NA,  And we actually mean it!
201111,64,64420,246,NA,NA,"Of course, we have differences of opinion with National too."
201111,64,64420,247,NA,NA,  We want to see much more vigorous action to deal with our problems than National has felt able to deliver over the last three years. 
201111,64,64420,248,NA,NA,"But we haven’t the slightest doubt that we could again work constructively with National, to the benefit of all New Zealanders – high income and low income; young and old; urban and rural; Maori, Asian, Pacifika and European."
201111,64,64420,249,NA,NA,And that’s my message to all New Zealanders.  ACT is the only party with the experience and the commitment which can help a John Key-led Government deal with the challenges which our country faces. 
201111,64,64420,250,NA,NA,And those challenges are huge. 
201111,64,64420,251,NA,NA,"In a world getting tired of countries which can’t live within their means, we’re still borrowing like there is no tomorrow."
201111,64,64420,252,NA,NA,"In a world where our people are getting steadily greyer, we’re not confronting the challenges posed by the increasing cost of New Zealand Super, of care for the aged, and of healthcare."
201111,64,64420,253,NA,NA,"In a world where people find it easier and easier to move countries, we’re drifting off the pace, and seeing too many of our young people deciding to make a better life for themselves somewhere else."
201111,64,64420,254,NA,NA,"A party vote for ACT at this election is your best way to ensure that we meet those challenges, for the benefit of all New Zealanders."
201111,64,64421,2,NA,NA,"New Zealanders should be able to take superannuation at reduced rates down to 60 or increasingly enhanced rates if they hold off until between 66 and 70,"
201111,64,64421,3,NA,NA,alongside making KiwiSaver compulsory.
201111,64,64421,4,NA,NA, Kiwis would then be able to manage their retirement age and lifestyle – choices they currently do not have
201111,64,64421,5,NA,NA,– and it would be cost neutral with the current scheme.
201111,64,64421,6,NA,NA," Each year below 65 that superannuation would be claimed down to 60, would see a small reduction, and each year over 65 up to 70, it would be enhanced."
201111,64,64421,7,NA,NA,"The final figures used would make it cost-neutral with the superannuation scheme as it stands,"
201111,64,64421,8,NA,NA,with the long term sustainability issue addressed by having compulsory KiwiSaver.
201111,64,64421,9,NA,NA," The sustainability arguments around superannuation, and whether it should be 65 or 67, then become redundant."
201111,64,64421,10,NA,NA, People can then do their own maths and work out what works best for them based on their lifestyle and aspirations.
201111,64,64421,11,NA,NA, It is very simple.
201111,64,64421,12,NA,NA,Our policy recognises that today people work and stay active for longer
201111,64,64421,13,NA,NA,– and it is sustainable for New Zealand in the long term
201111,64,64421,14,NA,NA,"when connected to compulsory KiwiSaver, which frankly we need to do as a nation at some point."
201111,64,64421,15,NA,NA,"Kiwis will have a working, sustainable and secured retirement future and that is what we need to be working towards."
201111,64,64421,16,NA,NA," In the meantime, what we propose gives them choice about how they want to shape their lives in retirement and when they want to begin."
201111,64,64421,19,NA,NA,Amend the superannuation formula so it is calculated on forecast changes to the CPI and average wage increase for the following 12 months.
201111,64,64421,20,NA,NA,"(Currently adjustments are made after the event, creating a time lag that cheats superannuitants of their full entitlement."

201111,64,64421,22,NA,NA,"Exempt those who have themselves contributed to overseas pension schemes from the provisions of Section 70 of the Social Security Act, which currently deducts the amount of their overseas pension from their NZ Superannuation entitlement, thereby penalising them for having provided for their own retirement."
201111,64,64421,23,NA,NA,Section 70 should only apply where an overseas pension has been fully funded from general tax revenues.
201111,64,64421,25,NA,NA,UnitedFuture believes the tax system should work in the interests of those raising families
201111,64,64421,26,NA,NA,and it should empower family and community self-sufficiency rather than creating dependency.
201111,64,64421,27,NA,NA,Income sharing recognises that the spouse or partner who has chosen to work part-time or has opted out of the paid work force in order to raise their children is making a vital contribution to our society.
201111,64,64421,28,NA,NA,"Income Sharing means that each partner in a relationship caring for children would be taxed on a 50% share of their combined income, resulting in a significant reduction in total income tax paid by the family."
201111,64,64421,29,NA,NA,"Income sharing recognises the costs of raising a family, and in particular, those situations where one parent is either a full-time carer for their children or works part-time."
201111,64,64421,30,NA,NA,"For tax purposes, the income of both parents is combined and then divided equally, which can mean that they pay less tax since it is levied at a lower rate under our progressive taxation system."
201111,64,64421,31,NA,NA,"Since the government subsidises childcare for those returning to paid work, it should also acknowledge the contribution of those who have decided to forego their income, in whole or in part, to stay at home with their children."
201111,64,64421,32,NA,NA,"UnitedFuture has introduced legislation for an income sharing scheme for parents with dependent children up to the age of 18, in addition to Working for Families and other entitlements."
201111,64,64421,34,NA,NA,The present tax system means that people who have no dependents pay exactly the same amount of tax as people with dependents.
201111,64,64421,35,NA,NA,Couples who are self-employed in farming or business and retired couples are already able to split their income for tax purposes but this is not available for those on PAYE incomes.
201111,64,64421,36,NA,NA,"According to the 2006 census, there were 310,000 two-parent families with dependent children (children under the age of 18 years, living at home) and most of these would benefit from income sharing."
201111,64,64421,41,NA,NA,UnitedFuture has two key policies to keep older New Zealanders warmer and healthier.
201111,64,64421,42,NA,NA,Both are about making New Zealand the kind of country it should be
201111,64,64421,43,NA,NA,and make economic sense.
201111,64,64421,44,NA,NA,"Subsidise the power bills of over-65s by $50 per month for the three coldest months of the year – June, July and August – so our seniors can afford to keep warm"

201111,64,64421,46,NA,NA,It is the decent thing to do in terms of how we treat the elderly in our country.
201111,64,64421,47,NA,NA,"Times are tough, but if you cut too many corners you end up with a false economy – and a very harsh country."
201111,64,64421,48,NA,NA," Each winter, on average an extra 3000 people a month are hospitalised at a cost to taxpayers of about $880 a day, and a great many of those people are elderly – that adds up to about $243 million in extra hospital costs each winter."
201111,64,64421,49,NA,NA," We have got to stop just looking at the initial cost of schemes, and measure them against what they save in the longer term through people being healthier and not being in our hospitals, and frankly, not dying because they get cold and sick."
201111,64,64421,50,NA,NA, We save cents and lose dollars.
201111,64,64421,51,NA,NA,It is a false economy and we see it too often.
201111,64,64421,52,NA,NA," Put that $243 million for increased winter hospitalisation up against our Winter Warmer policy cost of about $57 million to help keep a lot of elderly well, warm and out of hospital."
201111,64,64421,53,NA,NA, Death rates also jump 18 percent over winter – many of them elderly.
201111,64,64421,54,NA,NA,The subsidy could be implemented by a rebate on the power bill to be claimed back by the power company.
201111,64,64421,55,NA,NA,The $25 cost of the annual Warrant of Fitness health check for each senior citizen would be tiny when balanced against the $880 a day hospital tab picked up by the taxpayer when conditions not got on to early are far more serious and far more expensive to treat.
201111,64,64421,56,NA,NA,The combined cost of the two policies if fully taken up by all senior citizens would be about $71.5 million – $57 million for the power bill subsidy and $14.5 million for the WOF annual health check.

201111,64,64421,59,NA,NA,The National has a manifesto that includes asset sales.
201111,64,64421,60,NA,NA,New Zealanders need to start a proper debate on the future limits of those sales.
201111,64,64421,61,NA,NA,To this point there has not been a proper national debate beyond National saying yes and Labour saying no.
201111,64,64421,62,NA,NA,We need a conversation that is more detailed and drills down into what New Zealanders really think are acceptable bottom lines.
201111,64,64421,63,NA,NA,"New Zealanders are not definitively pro-asset sales, but under certain conditions, it is no longer the bogeyman issue that Labour would have you believe."
201111,64,64421,64,NA,NA,"UnitedFuture’s role as a support partner is not just to contribute its own policies, but to help keep a government to a reasonable, centrist path."
201111,64,64421,65,NA,NA,"UnitedFuture says let’s start with three no-go areas where there would be no asset sales, not now, not ever"
201111,64,64421,66,NA,NA,"Kiwibank, Radio New Zealand and the water supply should be ruled out of any future asset sales programmes"
201111,64,64421,67,NA,NA,"Kiwibank is in every sense now a national institution, whether you bank with it or not."
201111,64,64421,68,NA,NA,"And in a market full of Australian-owned banks, and an increasingly fraught and troubled globe, it is both a symbolic and practical statement of our economic sovereignty."
201111,64,64421,69,NA,NA,"Collectively, it is ours pure and simple."
201111,64,64421,70,NA,NA,It must stay that way.
201111,64,64421,71,NA,NA,"Radio New Zealand exists in an increasingly commercial media marketplace, and it is more important than ever to have a voice that does not bend to the dollar, to ratings, to external forces."
201111,64,64421,72,NA,NA,Every nation needs its own voice
201111,64,64421,73,NA,NA,and we need to afford that voice our collective protection.
201111,64,64421,74,NA,NA,Water. UnitedFuture does not intend to wait until it is on the asset sales agenda.
201111,64,64421,75,NA,NA,"New Zealanders would never – or should never – accept a sell-off of the supply of the water, or any of the aspects around it."
201111,64,64421,76,NA,NA,"In addition, with regard to Asset Sales, UnitedFurure will insist that:"
201111,64,64421,77,NA,NA,- The New Zealand Government retains majority control (51%)

201111,64,64620,2,NA,NA,"John Key: “Tomorrow’s decision is all about strengthening our economy, and helping our communities and families."
201111,64,64620,3,NA,NA,So now I’d like to take you through our plan.
201111,64,64620,4,NA,NA,"To do just that, to secure a brighter future."
201111,64,64620,6,NA,NA,Text: A stronger economy.
201111,64,64620,7,NA,NA,"170,000 more jobs."
201111,64,64620,8,NA,NA,Balance the books sooner.
201111,64,64620,10,NA,NA,Key: The first thing to acknowledge is that these have been very difficult economic times in New Zealand.
201111,64,64620,11,NA,NA,For a couple of reasons.
201111,64,64620,12,NA,NA,"Firstly, the global financial crisis is on-going and we are continuing to see countries with very high levels of debt."
201111,64,64620,13,NA,NA,"No great probability that they will get back into surplus any time soon, and as we can see in the United States and Europe that position has been extremely challenging."
201111,64,64620,14,NA,NA,"From New Zealand’s perspective we’re in much better shape, but what we do know is that we can’t afford to go out there and continue to borrow, and we have to get back into surplus as quickly as we can."
201111,64,64620,15,NA,NA,"And that is really what the plan has been focussed on, to make sure we do a few things economically."
201111,64,64620,16,NA,NA,"Firstly, make sure New Zealanders have jobs, and hopefully the highest paid jobs we possibly can,"
201111,64,64620,17,NA,NA,and we put the country back into the strongest position we can.
201111,64,64620,18,NA,NA,"The other thing we’ve had to contend with in New Zealand, of course, has been the earthquake, and I think it is worth putting a bit of perspective around that."
201111,64,64620,19,NA,NA,"I mean just to give you some idea, we’ve gone away and looked and we can’t find another natural disaster that’s had such a big impact on a developed economy such as New Zealand."
201111,64,64620,20,NA,NA,"So this is a very, very big event, it has had quite a dramatic effect on our economy."
201111,64,64620,21,NA,NA,"So we’ve very focussed on a few things, getting back into surplus as quickly as we can, and to give you some idea of that we’re going to halve our deficit this year, we’ll halve it again the year after that, and then fundamentally it will be gone."
201111,64,64620,22,NA,NA,That is the track we’re on.
201111,64,64620,23,NA,NA,"That’ll help take pressure off the Reserve Bank, it’ll help keep our interest rates lower, for longer, and make sure that New Zealand is in a much stronger position if we have to confront any other international challenges or challenges that might come our way."
201111,64,64620,24,NA,NA,"The second thing we’ve been working very hard on is to make sure that New Zealanders feel rewarded for their work, and that is why we’ve cut taxes and aligned our tax system."
201111,64,64620,25,NA,NA,And we undertook significant tax changes right across the board in 2010.
201111,64,64620,26,NA,NA,And that had quite a dramatic impact.
201111,64,64620,27,NA,NA,"Just to give you some idea, three-quarters of all New Zealanders face a top personal rate of no more than 17.5%."
201111,64,64620,28,NA,NA,"About half of all New Zealand families, when you take into consideration Working for Families, pay no tax whatsoever, so if you earn 50,000 dollars or less and have two children then you pay no tax in New Zealand."
201111,64,64620,29,NA,NA,"Another really important thing we’ve been doing, is trying to take the red tape off business, stream-lining our compliance costs, and making sure that New Zealanders feel encouraged actually to start new businesses and to hire people.”"

201111,64,64620,35,NA,NA,"Key: “So currently, before we became government one in five young New Zealanders left school with hopelessly inadequate numeracy and literacy skills."
201111,64,64620,36,NA,NA,"In other words, they couldn’t read and write properly."
201111,64,64620,37,NA,NA,"So can we really, can we as a country sit back and say, that we can afford to have 20% of all New Zealand children leaving with inadequate numeracy and literacy skills."
201111,64,64620,38,NA,NA,"And the answer to that is patently no, we can’t."
201111,64,64620,39,NA,NA,"It doesn’t matter what job you undertake, in the modern economy in New Zealand you need to be able to read and write properly."
201111,64,64620,40,NA,NA,"And so what National standards is all about is not some sort of test for five year olds, it is monitoring the progress of that child."
201111,64,64620,41,NA,NA,"So it asks some obvious questions, it says if the average five year old can count to ten we want to understand whether you child can count to ten, and most importantly if they can’t ask why not and what are we doing about it."
201111,64,64620,42,NA,NA,"And schools are free to use whatever method they want to make that assessment, uhm, but what they are required to do is, in plain english, report to you the progress that your child is making."
201111,64,64620,43,NA,NA,And that allows us to very early on pick up some issues that manifest themselves in some young children.
201111,64,64620,44,NA,NA,"Maybe their eyesight isn’t good, maybe they have dyslexia, uhm, whatever the reason might be it is crucially important we identify that progress and we help, uhm, make change."
201111,64,64620,45,NA,NA,"Because in the end, in a modern day New Zealand, it is an absolute basic function of the education system that very Kiwi comes out being able to read and write properly."
201111,64,64620,46,NA,NA,And if we don’t do that we rob this country and those New Zealanders of a future.
201111,64,64620,47,NA,NA,"Personally, I believe in equality of opportunity."
201111,64,64620,48,NA,NA,"And the only way we will ever get equality of opportunity is where every child, it doesn’t matter what background they come from, what household they come from, what part of New Zealand they come from, come out of school, with a world class education."
201111,64,64620,49,NA,NA,"And that has to be an ability to read, write and do maths."
201111,64,64620,50,NA,NA,"And we owe that to every child, and I believe every parent in New Zealand. “"

201111,64,64620,57,NA,NA,So the only way you make the boat go faster is when you have an infrastructure that will allow you to be competitive and efficient.
201111,64,64620,58,NA,NA,"And if you go and have a look around the countries in the world, that are competitive in the world, they have world class infrastructure."
201111,64,64620,59,NA,NA,"When we have broadband that means we can reach out to the world, all of a sudden you can run a business from any small town or large town in New Zealand and have a world-wide customer base that is affordable."
201111,64,64620,60,NA,NA,"You can do that through the internet, but you can’t do that if you don’t have a reliable, fast internet connection."
201111,64,64620,61,NA,NA,"If you spend, you know, 30 minutes or an hour every day locked up in traffic that is time you are not at work or not with your family, certainly not productive, so it is crucially important we have that for economic growth, for higher wages, and actually for delivering a society where people actually enjoy, you know, what they’re doing as they go about, whether it is work or play."
201111,64,64620,62,NA,NA,"So, you are right, uhm, in terms of paying for that we need to make some choices,"
201111,64,64620,63,NA,NA,and one of the choices that the government has made is that we want to follow what is called the mixed ownership model.
201111,64,64620,64,NA,NA,"So that is that we do want to sell down, a minority stake in four of the assets than New Zealand owns,"
201111,64,64620,65,NA,NA,"and by taking that capital out of those particular companies, but keeping a majority stake in those companies, we want to use that money to build other assets in our economy."
201111,64,64620,66,NA,NA,"We’re proposing a model which you will understand is the Air New Zealand model, which means the government not only has, but always keeps, a majority 51% control as a share minimum, and possibly more."
201111,64,64620,67,NA,NA,"It means that we release that capital, and what we actually do is use that to build even more assets."
201111,64,64620,68,NA,NA,"So at the end of that process, New Zealanders won’t have less assets they’ll actually have more assets than they currently do."
201111,64,64620,69,NA,NA,"So we want to use that money, that we are releasing, to build that infrastructure without having to borrow more money."
201111,64,64620,70,NA,NA,"And as I said earlier, what we’re seeing around the world is a very fragile international environment."
201111,64,64620,71,NA,NA,"You’ve got countries in Europe and the United States that are extremely debt laden; they’ve got a lot of debt, and the last thing we want is for New Zealand to be a highly indebted country."
201111,64,64620,72,NA,NA,"So that is how we’re going to pay for it, and that is why we’re going to do it.”"
201111,64,64620,74,NA,NA,Text: 600 more police on the beat.

201111,64,64620,78,NA,NA,"“Yes, so I think it is a basic right of every New Zealander to feel safe in their own home."
201111,64,64620,79,NA,NA,And I remember in 2008 we campaigned very strongly on the issue of law and order.
201111,64,64620,80,NA,NA,"So if you look at our record over the last three years, I don’t think you can point to any other government that has implemented as much change as we have in the area of law and order to try and make New Zealanders safer,"
201111,64,64620,81,NA,NA,and actually that plan is working for the vast overwhelming bulk of regions around the country we’re actually seeing our crime rates falling.
201111,64,64620,82,NA,NA,"We added 600 extra police, on the streets, on the beat in New Zealand, to again make sure that people feel more secure and as an added deterrent to those who might conduct crime."
201111,64,64620,83,NA,NA,But we’ve also made a raft of different changes in terms of legislation to send that message that we’re not going to tolerate crime.
201111,64,64620,84,NA,NA,"For criminals that are intent on committing crimes that are very significant and serious in nature, we’ve implemented the three strikes policy."
201111,64,64620,85,NA,NA,"Where eventually there will be no parole, ah, you’ll be in prison for the rest of your life, if you continue to conduct those types of crimes,"
201111,64,64620,86,NA,NA,"ah, we’ve lengthened the sentences in a lot of particular areas, particularly for crimes against children for instance."
201111,64,64620,87,NA,NA,"Ah, we changed the bail laws so it is harder for people to get bail."
201111,64,64620,88,NA,NA,"We’ve given the police much greater powers, all so that they can keep you safer, ah, and protect you in your homes."
201111,64,64620,89,NA,NA,One of the areas we know that can drive criminal activity is the use of drugs.
201111,64,64620,90,NA,NA,"And so my office has personally lead the charge in that area of methyl P use as it is sometimes known, and the results are starting to work."
201111,64,64620,91,NA,NA,"In a number of recent surveys, ah, we’re seeing the price of P on the street rising, and the number of clan labs that have actually been busted is falling."
201111,64,64620,92,NA,NA,And that is all an example we are making progress.
201111,64,64620,93,NA,NA,"So there is a lot more to be done, but ah, I give New Zealanders an absolute commitment that I remain very focussed on making sure that their safety and security is a top priority.”"

201111,64,64620,99,NA,NA,"Key: “One of the things we’ve been doing in the last three years, as the government, is to make sure we provide better services for New Zealanders."
201111,64,64620,100,NA,NA,And fundamentally that has meant reducing the amount of money we spend as a government on bureaucracy
201111,64,64620,101,NA,NA,and increasing the amount of money we spend in the areas that we think are critically important to a good and fully functioning health system.
201111,64,64620,102,NA,NA,"And that means we’ve employed a lot more doctors, a lot more nurses, more midwives, and we’re spending more money on pharmaceuticals."
201111,64,64620,103,NA,NA,"And we’re starting to see some great results there, so we’ve conducted around 27,000 additional surgical operations last year."
201111,64,64620,104,NA,NA,"The waiting list for cancer treatment in New Zealand is now no more than four weeks, and often less."
201111,64,64620,105,NA,NA,"Unlike the previous government, we haven’t sent anyone to Australia for cancer treatment, we’ve been treating people in New Zealand so that is a great sign of how those are working."
201111,64,64620,106,NA,NA,"When we first became the government you may remember we fully funded hercetrin, which is a very specific, but expensive, drug that treats a certain type of cancer, and that has taken a lot of pressure off New Zealand families, and particularly New Zealand women."
201111,64,64620,107,NA,NA,"Ah, and I think that has been a great step forward;"
201111,64,64620,108,NA,NA,you’ve got to make sure you put money in the right place
201111,64,64620,109,NA,NA,"and that is more front line services, less bureaucracy, and very focussed on delivering heath care that is close to home, that is convenient and actually delivers top class results for New Zealanders.”"

201111,64,64620,116,NA,NA,And we think that that number is too high.
201111,64,64620,117,NA,NA,"So, ah, when we look at that real issue of children growing up in poverty, what we see is an awful lot of those children are growing up in welfare based homes."
201111,64,64620,118,NA,NA,"So we do want to reorient the welfare system, to make sure that important safety net is there for Kiwis when they need it, and there will be many kiwis that do, either temporarily or in some cases for all of their life,"
201111,64,64620,119,NA,NA,but we’ve also got to make sure that we really encourage people to go to work if they can work.
201111,64,64620,120,NA,NA,There are a number of fundamental changes that we are also proposing to make.
201111,64,64620,121,NA,NA,"So, for instance, the area of young people is a specific issue we are focussing on."
201111,64,64620,122,NA,NA,"The historical position, and policy adopted by previous governments had been that if you are young and say you’re 16 or 17 or 18 and on the domestic purposes benefit, the DPB you’re a young mum, then we just give you money and there is no other obligation."
201111,64,64620,123,NA,NA,"And, I say, that is not working, that is wrong, and actually that policy has a label we can attach to it, it is called abandonment."
201111,64,64620,124,NA,NA,"We’re actually, asking a very young person to raise a child, typically on their own."
201111,64,64620,125,NA,NA,And I think those days have to be over.
201111,64,64620,126,NA,NA,"Firstly, we’re going to make sure we provide support around that young person."
201111,64,64620,127,NA,NA,"We’re going to make sure that they’re in some form of training, we’re going to make sure that they’re attending parenting courses."
201111,64,64620,128,NA,NA,"The second thing we’re going to do is we are going to pay their rent directly, we’re going to pay their electricity bill directly, so that their home is warm for themselves and their child."
201111,64,64620,129,NA,NA,"And the third thing we’re going to do is we’re going to start putting some of that benefit on a payment card, which means that the money can be used for food, but it can’t be used for cigarettes and alcohol."
201111,64,64620,130,NA,NA,And I think that is a very important step.”

201111,64,64621,1,NA,NA,Thank you for your welcome and for the work you have done over the last three years to bring us to this important meeting.
201111,64,64621,2,NA,NA,2011 is the most important election we have faced in our lifetimes.

201111,64,64621,4,NA,NA,November 26 decides whether the future of New Zealand belongs to the few - the favoured and special interests?
201111,64,64621,5,NA,NA,Or will our next Parliament serve the collective interest of all New Zealanders?
201111,64,64621,6,NA,NA,NZ First's stand is this - every citizen of this country is entitled to a fair go.
201111,64,64621,7,NA,NA,If you look back over the past three years it is crystal clear why our enemies spent such time and money to get us out of Parliament.

201111,64,64621,9,NA,NA,Let other political parties stand for special interests at the expense of the many but that has never been our position.

201111,64,64621,13,NA,NA,"No ifs, buts or maybe's."
201111,64,64621,14,NA,NA,We started out with fifteen founding principles
201111,64,64621,15,NA,NA,- the same number that makes up a world champion rugby team.
201111,64,64621,16,NA,NA,"The principles have not changed, for they are sound, and now other political parties all of a sudden claim them as theirs."
201111,64,64621,17,NA,NA,Who would have believed that Labour - which sold so many state assets - would grab our policy of keeping them!
201111,64,64621,18,NA,NA,Or National - keeping the pension age at 65 when all their background sentiment has been to attack it.
201111,64,64621,19,NA,NA,They are saying that because they are scared of NZ First.
201111,64,64621,20,NA,NA,Or both the old parties who rejected compulsory savings 14 years ago now saying they are partially for it.
201111,64,64621,21,NA,NA,"Or National who squeezed out after hours doctor visits for under sixes, in this eleventh hour, now saying they are for it."
201111,64,64621,22,NA,NA,NZ First believes that the welfare of all the people of New Zealand should come first.
201111,64,64621,23,NA,NA,It's in our name.
201111,64,64621,24,NA,NA,"That means the young, the old, the workers, farmers, small businesses, professionals and everybody else should have a fair go - a fair share."
201111,64,64621,25,NA,NA,We know of the hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who are now forgotten
201111,64,64621,26,NA,NA,The people who don't get a fair go.
201111,64,64621,27,NA,NA,Mr Key went to South Auckland before the last election and promised the people there a better life.
201111,64,64621,28,NA,NA,Did it happen? No!
201111,64,64621,29,NA,NA,What did they actually do?
201111,64,64621,30,NA,NA,"Well, they increased the tax people pay on their food, their clothing, their petrol, their doctors' bills."
201111,64,64621,31,NA,NA,Increased the tax on everything people need to live.
201111,64,64621,32,NA,NA,And then at the same time They gave the rich people big tax cuts.
201111,64,64621,33,NA,NA,For the National Party bosses and their mates it was worth thousands of dollars a week.
201111,64,64621,34,NA,NA,They threw a few dollars at the pensioners.
201111,64,64621,35,NA,NA,"But price increases have gone through the roof, so the crumbs have all gone, and any savings are being swallowed up as well."
201111,64,64621,36,NA,NA,It is simply not fair!
201111,64,64621,37,NA,NA,The special interests have been grabbing more and more of the profits made from the efforts of the New Zealand people.
201111,64,64621,38,NA,NA,The fat cats are making a killing.
201111,64,64621,39,NA,NA,Most of the profits are going to foreign owners or tax dodgers here at home.
201111,64,64621,40,NA,NA,The rich list's wealth last year went up by a massive 20%.
201111,64,64621,41,NA,NA,"CEO's who used to get 30 times the average wage are now getting 100 times, or more, that wage."
201111,64,64621,42,NA,NA,Which CEO's performance justifies that?
201111,64,64621,43,NA,NA,"We stand for a fair tax system, where everyone pays a fair share."
201111,64,64621,44,NA,NA,"So we are going to rewrite and simplify NZ's mangle of tax laws so that they are understandable, unavoidable, and fair."
201111,64,64621,45,NA,NA,Everyone will pay their fair taxes.
201111,64,64621,47,NA,NA,- Less personal tax
201111,64,64621,48,NA,NA,- Less company tax
201111,64,64621,49,NA,NA,- Less GST at 12.5 not 15%
201111,64,64621,50,NA,NA,- Removing double tax on savings
201111,64,64621,51,NA,NA,- Removing GST on rates
201111,64,64621,52,NA,NA,- Removing secondary tax
201111,64,64621,53,NA,NA,Over 90% will be better off.
201111,64,64621,54,NA,NA,"It is not fair for a young person, with two jobs, stacking supermarket shelves all night to pay secondary tax while a very rich person with millions pays no tax."
201111,64,64621,55,NA,NA,It's not fair that you pay tax on savings interest less than the inflation rate and then get slammed with tax on top of that.
201111,64,64621,56,NA,NA,"So inflation above 4%, interest less than 4% on which you pay 33% tax."
201111,64,64621,57,NA,NA,Are you going forward or back?
201111,64,64621,58,NA,NA,"GST on rates is a tax on a tax, that's intellectual fraud, and we're going to abolish it."
201111,64,64621,59,NA,NA,The multi-millionaires must pay their share.
201111,64,64621,60,NA,NA,"Warren Buffet and Sam Morgan, (Trade Me), believe that and so do we."
201111,64,64621,61,NA,NA,And we will make sure they do!
201111,64,64621,62,NA,NA,There's been a lot of unfair cost cutting over the past three years.
201111,64,64621,63,NA,NA,Like elderly getting home help hours slashed by district health boards - health boards doing the government's dirty work.
201111,64,64621,64,NA,NA,But when it comes to the government's mates in collapsed finance companies the sky's the limit.
201111,64,64621,65,NA,NA,The bill for the taxpayer from the South Canterbury collapse fiasco will be $1 billion.
201111,64,64621,66,NA,NA,"Some made a fortune, because they got very high interest rates backed by a government guarantee."
201111,64,64621,67,NA,NA,"The government guaranteed South Canterbury Finance, placed no cap on further fund raising activity, so they had a field day and raised a further $800 million, and on Friday Mr English said, you were going to pay for it."
201111,64,64621,68,NA,NA,"Mr Key, English, Joyce, these economic geniuses were all ""asleep at the wheel"""
201111,64,64621,69,NA,NA,At the same time other finance companies went to the wall and thousands of senior citizens lost billions of life savings.
201111,64,64621,70,NA,NA,It was simply not fair.
201111,64,64621,71,NA,NA,It's not a Fair Go
201111,64,64621,72,NA,NA,New Zealand First has always stood for equal treatment of all citizens.
201111,64,64621,73,NA,NA,"In 2004 NZ First concerned with the threat to public ownership of the foreshore and seabed, came up with a solution, after consulting Coastal Maori, confirming Crown ownership for all of us."
201111,64,64621,74,NA,NA,"That meant that the people of New Zealand, all the people, were the rightful owners."
201111,64,64621,75,NA,NA,At the same time we made sure the traditional customary rights of Maori were guaranteed.
201111,64,64621,76,NA,NA,Coastal Maori supported our solution publicly.
201111,64,64621,77,NA,NA,Mr Key and National changed that in an act of political stupidity.
201111,64,64621,78,NA,NA,"Much of the foreshore and seabed can now be privatised, in the interest of a select few who will make money out of it."
201111,64,64621,79,NA,NA,We've been betrayed - all of us - whatever our race.
201111,64,64621,80,NA,NA,At no stage did Maori ever believe they owned the foreshore and seabed.
201111,64,64621,81,NA,NA,Land and sea were never the same for Maori
201111,64,64621,82,NA,NA,"It was and is a source of food, a way of transport and a place of recreation."
201111,64,64621,83,NA,NA,We all should have right of access and freedom to enjoy our coastline.
201111,64,64621,84,NA,NA,It is also rich in resources that should be shared.
201111,64,64621,85,NA,NA,"Ordinary Maori want Housing, Health, Education"
201111,64,64621,86,NA,NA,and a job with First World wages.
201111,64,64621,87,NA,NA,"Come to think of it, that is what we all want."
201111,64,64621,88,NA,NA,"What European, Polynesian, Indian, Chinese, Asian people all want."
201111,64,64621,89,NA,NA,NZ First understands that.
201111,64,64621,90,NA,NA,With Crown ownership of the Foreshore and Seabed you were guaranteed a fair deal.
201111,64,64621,91,NA,NA,"Now, you are guaranteed nothing."
201111,64,64621,92,NA,NA,And worst of all - all sorts of deals can be done over the foreshore and seabed behind closed doors in Parliament.
201111,64,64621,93,NA,NA,Under John Key and National you now have two flags.
201111,64,64621,94,NA,NA,The old one and Hone's one.
201111,64,64621,95,NA,NA,Under John Key and National you now have a UN declaration that says that some New Zealander's rights override the rest of New Zealander's rights.
201111,64,64621,96,NA,NA,Under John Key and National you have a behind the scenes Constitutional Committee drafting a new Constitution with the Treaty of Waitangi as it's cornerstone.
201111,64,64621,97,NA,NA,The greatest Maori politician Ngata would think this an absurdity.
201111,64,64621,98,NA,NA,"And yet no one, not Mr Key, not National, has ever asked you"
201111,64,64621,99,NA,NA,"Secret deals can, and are being done, between people whose only thought is for their own special interests - and their pockets."
201111,64,64621,100,NA,NA,You have no say.
201111,64,64621,101,NA,NA,It's not a fair go.
201111,64,64621,103,NA,NA,How will New Zealanders own their own country given the rate at which our prime assets and land is falling into foreign ownership?
201111,64,64621,104,NA,NA,How will we have a manufacturing sector left if we conclude any more so called free trade agreements that undermine our industry?
201111,64,64621,105,NA,NA,How will we be more prosperous when our export base struggles with a grossly overvalued exchange rate?
201111,64,64621,106,NA,NA,And how will our young people have work and prosperous futures if we do not deal with these issues?
201111,64,64621,107,NA,NA,Because in all these areas New Zealand First has specific policies to address the fundamental problems we face.
201111,64,64621,108,NA,NA,And unless we do address them the long decline of New Zealand's standard of living relative to other comparable countries will continue.
201111,64,64621,109,NA,NA,We say New Zealanders deserve better.
201111,64,64621,110,NA,NA,Policies should pass three simple but clear tests: Do they put the interests of New Zealand first?
201111,64,64621,111,NA,NA,Do they unite us as a nation?
201111,64,64621,112,NA,NA,Do they make us a stronger society and economy?
201111,64,64621,113,NA,NA,Right now another secret deal that is being done behind closed doors is the Trans Pacific Partnership.
201111,64,64621,114,NA,NA,This is a free trade arrangement around the Pacific involving New Zealand and the United States.
201111,64,64621,115,NA,NA,Some of the leaked reports of the concessions we are making are alarming.
201111,64,64621,116,NA,NA,"If Mr Key did not take pharmaceuticals off the table, so they are part of the negotiations"
201111,64,64621,117,NA,NA,New Zealand First has no argument with the United States.
201111,64,64621,118,NA,NA,We have no quarrel with the American people.
201111,64,64621,119,NA,NA,In fact because of us we are closer than in a quarter of a century
201111,64,64621,120,NA,NA,But we will not accept that American drug companies and other American commercial interests can rip us off and tell us what to do.
201111,64,64621,121,NA,NA,It's not a Fair Go and we won't let it happen.
201111,64,64621,122,NA,NA,Trade deals should benefit all parties.
201111,64,64621,123,NA,NA,Not just the wide boys of Wall St.
201111,64,64621,124,NA,NA,"Every day, we are swamped in bad news about an economic crisis somewhere around the globe."
201111,64,64621,125,NA,NA,Countries are going broke.
201111,64,64621,126,NA,NA,Capitalism has been turned upside down.
201111,64,64621,127,NA,NA,"People are coming to realize that some bankers, finance traders, currency speculators, futures traders, derivative marketers are a bunch of crooks."
201111,64,64621,128,NA,NA,The rot started in America where the financial wheeler dealers lent mortgage money to people who could not possibly afford to repay it.
201111,64,64621,129,NA,NA,They knew that.
201111,64,64621,130,NA,NA,But they bundled up these shonky mortgages and traded them as gilt edged securities with Triple A ratings.
201111,64,64621,131,NA,NA,The criminals who dreamed up these schemes made a fortune.
201111,64,64621,132,NA,NA,Then these deals collapsed like a deck of cards.
201111,64,64621,133,NA,NA,All around the world - except in a few countries - they got caught up in a bubble of speculation.
201111,64,64621,134,NA,NA,The bubble burst and governments have been bailing out the banks.
201111,64,64621,135,NA,NA,Whole economies are being kept afloat by governments printing money and pouring it into the system.
201111,64,64621,136,NA,NA,And the crooks who started it all are back creaming it!
201111,64,64621,137,NA,NA,They live like leeches on ordinary people.
201111,64,64621,138,NA,NA,Is this a Fair Go?
201111,64,64621,139,NA,NA,Is this want you want?
201111,64,64621,140,NA,NA,"In New Zealand we are seriously affected by the speculators and the traders that make up this mythical thing called ""the market""."
201111,64,64621,141,NA,NA,"Their wheeling and dealing has the Kiwi dollar bouncing up and down, higher and higher."
201111,64,64621,142,NA,NA,That is a nightmare for our exporters in the engine room of our economy.
201111,64,64621,143,NA,NA,The exporters create our real wealth.
201111,64,64621,144,NA,NA,We have a plan to help them.
201111,64,64621,145,NA,NA,New Zealand First will keep our currency pegged to that of our main trading partners.
201111,64,64621,146,NA,NA,"That way the exporters will be able to expand, increase exports and create new jobs, new wealth for the Family New Zealand"
201111,64,64621,147,NA,NA,"We will stop the sale of state owned assets, and the control of our power stations and the lakes and rivers that feed them."
201111,64,64621,148,NA,NA,Will stop the sale of our prime farmland to foreign interests.
201111,64,64621,149,NA,NA,It is obscene that a former National prime minister fronts a communist owned company that's gobbling up New Zealand companies and assets.
201111,64,64621,151,NA,NA,"""I believe in New Zealanders owning their own industry, all industry, wherever practicable..."
201111,64,64621,152,NA,NA,"This country is growing up, and I want it to see it owned and controlled by New Zealanders in every possible sphere."
201111,64,64621,153,NA,NA,"There is, of course, also an economic reason - the bleeding away of overseas funds and the paying of tribute to people overseas...."
201111,64,64621,154,NA,NA,"I, for one, want to see New Zealand mature, to grow up in its own sense, have its own soul, develop its own character, and have control of its own destiny in all spheres of the economy......."
201111,64,64621,155,NA,NA,"This is my simple faith""."
201111,64,64621,156,NA,NA,Who said that?
201111,64,64621,157,NA,NA,"""Kiwi Keith Holyoake said that."
201111,64,64621,158,NA,NA,What would he think of his party now?
201111,64,64621,159,NA,NA,"And it's just as obscene to see Don Brash, another failed National leader, take over the rotting carcass of ACT in a desperate attempt to twist and distort the democratic process."
201111,64,64621,160,NA,NA,New Zealand First upholds democracy.
201111,64,64621,161,NA,NA,The right to choose a government belongs to the people - not the politicians.
201111,64,64621,162,NA,NA,And it doesn't belong to the special interests behind political parties.
201111,64,64621,164,NA,NA,1)    More trade training for our young people
201111,64,64621,165,NA,NA,2)    We will help pay the wages for apprentices using dole money and an employer top up
201111,64,64621,166,NA,NA,3)    We will help students pay their loans as long as they qualify and stay here
201111,64,64621,167,NA,NA,4)    And we'll throw out fictitious national standards in early education opposed by 90% of the teachers
201111,64,64621,168,NA,NA,We will crank up KiwiSaver
201111,64,64621,169,NA,NA,and use the money to buy back assets
201111,64,64621,170,NA,NA,We will seriously shake up the Overseas Investment Office so they learn the difference between genuine overseas investment and a foreign corporate raid that creates no wealth and no new employment.
201111,64,64621,171,NA,NA,We'll have ONE LAW FOR ALL.
201111,64,64621,173,NA,NA,- We all own our foreshore and seabed

201111,64,64621,177,NA,NA,- We have one social welfare system
201111,64,64621,178,NA,NA,- A NZ health system
201111,64,64621,179,NA,NA,- A NZ education system
201111,64,64621,180,NA,NA,We will rebuild our failing economy with
201111,64,64621,181,NA,NA,- Export plans to treble returns

201111,64,64621,186,NA,NA,- Rewards for the nation's builders
201111,64,64621,187,NA,NA,And remember the SuperGold Card?
201111,64,64621,188,NA,NA,With discounts and free transport?
201111,64,64621,189,NA,NA,And super back to 66%
201111,64,64621,190,NA,NA,That card will become even more valuable
201111,64,64621,191,NA,NA,With your doctor's bills and your power bills.
201111,64,64621,192,NA,NA,With some government charges like motor re-licensing.
201111,64,64621,193,NA,NA,And we're not falling for Super at 67 starting four elections from now.
201111,64,64621,194,NA,NA,"When last we had the power we brought in 1000 extra front line police, and 235 in the office to back them up."
201111,64,64621,195,NA,NA,We funded the Maori Wardens so they could play a real role in law and order.
201111,64,64621,196,NA,NA,These two changes made a dramatic difference to crime.
201111,64,64621,197,NA,NA,Yet National is trying to take all the credit.
201111,64,64621,198,NA,NA,Over the last three years there's been a voice missing in our democracy.
201111,64,64621,199,NA,NA,It is the voice of the people.
201111,64,64621,200,NA,NA,People are waking up.
201111,64,64621,201,NA,NA,Do not be discouraged by tricky opinion polls and media experts.
201111,64,64621,202,NA,NA,The opinion polls have never shown our true level of support.
201111,64,64621,203,NA,NA,They are all over the place and anyone who believes them needs their head examined.
201111,64,64621,204,NA,NA,"Over 95,000 people voted for NZ First in 2008, more than three parliamentary parties got all together."
201111,64,64621,205,NA,NA,"Over 95,000, despite the most vicious character assassination and lies seen in any campaign this country has ever witnessed."
201111,64,64621,206,NA,NA,And the people who fed and led these lies didn't even believe it themselves.
201111,64,64621,207,NA,NA,They were paid to say it.
201111,64,64621,208,NA,NA,"A group even agreed on TV ""Well if he is not guilty he's still a hypocrite"""
201111,64,64621,209,NA,NA,"Over 95,000 stayed loyal."
201111,64,64621,210,NA,NA,And you know that with your help we can more than double that on November 26.
